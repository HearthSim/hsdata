VO_LichKing_Male_Human_PrologueBossCoin_01	Come, champion! I will annihilate you and disenchant you for Arcane Dust!
VO_LichKing_Male_Human_PrologueBossCoin_02	I built this hideous bone amalgamation from the grisly remains of my duplicate cards. 
VO_LichKing_Male_Human_PrologueBossCoin_03	Deathbringer Saurfang was my first Legendary minion. I built this whole adventure around him.
VO_LichKing_Male_Human_PrologueBossCoin_04	This is Lady Deathwhisper. Before she got nerfed!
VO_LichKing_Male_Human_PrologueBossCoin_05	Professor Putricide is my card draw engine. But all he draws is “Gas.” I really dislike him.
VO_LichKing_Male_Human_PrologueBossCoin_07	Lana’thel!! There are TEETH MARKS in my CARDS! I told you to put them in SLEEVES! 
VO_LichKing_Male_Human_PrologueBossCoin_08	Sindragosa is my finisher! Stay away! You can not have her!
VO_LichKing_Male_Human_PrologueBossCoin_09	You will beg for my mercy. You will press the “concede” button, and I will deny you.
VO_LichKing_Male_Human_PrologueBossCoin_11	Look at your hand, champion. Look at what you’ve become. Are we really so different, you and I? 
VO_LichKing_Male_Human_PrologueBossCoin_12	Now I stand, a lion before lambs… and they do not fear.
VO_LichKing_Male_Human_ExpansionIntro_02	Icecrown! Come for the terrible power. Stay... because you’re dead.
VO_LichKing_Male_Human_LowerCitadelUnlock_01	Icecrown Citadel! A collection of my most hideous minions, crafted not with dust… but with HATE.
VO_LichKing_Male_Human_UpperReachesLock_01	You seek to turn my power against me? Hold fast while I net-deck something that will forever shroud this world in darkness.
VO_LichKing_Male_Human_UpperReachesUnlock_01	You seek to turn my own power against me? Do you know how many times I’ve ranked Legend?
VO_LichKing_Male_Human_FinaleLock_01	You will NEVER defeat me! Not while this wing is locked, at least.
VO_LichKing_Male_Human_FinaleUnlock_03	Shall I lay down Frostmourne and throw myself at your mercy? Spoiler: I will NOT.
VO_LichKing_Male_Human_FinaleFirstVictory_01	Impossible… Impossible… What do you say, best of nine?

VO_ICC01_Jaina_Female_Human_PostDeath_02	We must… resist…
VO_ICC01_Jaina_Female_Human_JainaDKIntro_05	I hear the whispers… of the dead…
VO_ICC01_LichKing_Male_Human_EndOfTurn2_01	Hahaha – THAT’s my opener!
VO_ICC01_LichKing_Male_Human_EndOfTurn2_02	This isn’t even my aggressive deck. 
VO_ICC01_LichKing_Male_Human_PlaysFrostmourne_01	Your ranking will suffer.
VO_ICC01_LichKing_Male_Human_JainaDKIntro_01	Rise up, mage. Your work is not complete. 
VO_ICC01_LichKing_Male_Human_JainaDKIntro_02	Join me. The living will tremble and the dead will obey.
VO_ICC01_LichKing_Male_Human_JainaDKIntro_03	Your enemies will fear you more than death itself…
VO_ICC01_LichKing_Male_Human_Idle_01	Go ahead. End your turn, so that I can end you!
VO_ICC01_LichKing_Male_Human_Intro_01	Choose your cards carefully. You have been dealt your last.
VO_ICC01_LichKing_Male_Human_Turn1_01	My cards are so good…
VO_ICC01_LichKing_Male_Human_Turn11_01	My hordes of undead are yours to command.
VO_ICC01_LichKing_Male_Human_Turn13_01	Make them suffer.
VO_ICC01_LichKing_Male_Human_Turn15_01	Mercy is for the weak.

VO_ICC01_Tirion_Male_Human_EndOfTurn4_03	Have faith that providence will deliver in your time of need.
VO_ICC01_Tirion_Male_Human_JainaDKintro_05	What is this? What have you become!?

VO_ICC01_Tirion_Male_Human_Turn2_01	Have no fear, champion! We are on our way.
VO_ICC01_Tirion_Male_Human_Turn3_01	We’re almost there! How are things going? Good?
VO_ICC01_Tirion_Male_Human_Turn6_01	Champion, we’re just about ready to-
VO_ICC01_Tirion_Male_Human_Turn6_02	What!?
VO_ICC01_Tirion_Male_Human_Turn8_01	You face the finest adventurers of Azeroth!
VO_ICC01_Tirion_Male_Human_Flavor01_01	I’m going to need some better adventurers…
VO_ICC01_Tirion_Male_Human_Flavor02_01	Jaina, you’ve become a monster!
VO_ICC01_Tirion_Male_Human_Flavor03_01	The Lich King will pay for this atrocity! 
VO_ICC01_Jaina_Female_Human_DrawsRager_01	Are you serious right now!?
VO_ICC01_LichKing_Male_Human_JainaDKintro_06	Now, champion, clear this worthless trash from my doorstep.
VO_ICC01_LichKing_Male_Human_EmoteResponse_01	Your pleas for mercy ring hollow.
VO_ICC01_Tirion_Male_Human_EmoteResponse_02	I don’t even know you anymore!

VO_ICC04_Sindragosa_Female_Dragon_Intro_01	You are a fool to come to this place!
VO_ICC04_Sindragosa_Female_Dragon_PlayerPlaysMinion_02	Choose your victims with care. The cold hand of death will claim you all. 
VO_ICC04_LichKing_Male_Human_BreathNoMinion_01	What, no minions for Sindragosa to freeze? That’s cold.
VO_ICC04_Sindragosa_Female_Dragon_BreathNoRoomLeft_01	You have no more minions to hide behind.
VO_ICC04_LichKing_Male_Human_Turn5_01	You may be wondering, “How do I get rid of these ice blocks?”
VO_ICC04_LichKing_Male_Human_Turn5_02	The answer is: You can’t!
VO_ICC04_Sindragosa_Female_Dragon_UnchainedMagic_02	Your pathetic magic betrays you!
VO_ICC04_Sindragosa_Female_Dragon_UnchainedMagic_04	Suffer!
VO_ICC04_Sindragosa_Female_Dragon_SecondBreath_01	Feel my master’s limitless power and despair.
VO_ICC04_Sindragosa_Female_Dragon_Death_01	Roaaaaarr!
VO_ICC04_LichKing_Male_Human_Win_02	THIS ENTIRE DECK MUST BE PURGED! 
VO_ICC04_LichKing_Male_Human_Lose_01	Your frozen remains will serve as a warning to the others…
VO_ICC04_Sindragosa_Female_Dragon_EmoteResponse_01	I tire of these games!
VO_ICC04_Sindragosa_Female_Dragon_LichKing_01	I have been betrayed!
VO_ICC04_Sindragosa_Female_Dragon_TransformDK_01	I serve only one master!
VO_ICC04_Sindragosa_Female_Dragon_Sindragosa_01	Our pathetic magic betrays us!
VO_ICC04_Sindragosa_Female_Dragon_Sindragosa_02	Our pathetic magic betrays us!
VO_ICC04_Sindragosa_Female_Dragon_Bounce_01	Bring it back!

VO_ICC05_Lanathel_Female_Sanlayn_BiteReminder_01	Are you forgetting something? The thirst burns in your veins!
VO_ICC05_Lanathel_Female_Sanlayn_BiteReminderAcolyte_01	Do not hesitate. Feed! Feed on the sleeping ones!

VO_ICC05_Lanathel_Female_Sanlayn_BloodEssence_01	It’s getting too crowded in here.
VO_ICC05_Lanathel_Female_Sanlayn_BloodEssence_02	You didn’t have plans for those, did you?
VO_ICC05_Lanathel_Female_Sanlayn_BloodEssence_03	Let’s mix things up, hmm?
VO_ICC05_Lanathel_Female_Sanlayn_Turn3_01	Why not feed on one of MY minions?
VO_ICC05_Lanathel_Female_Sanlayn_Turn3_02	They’re dormant… And delicious… and covered in gravy! 
VO_ICC05_LichKing_Male_Human_BossBite_02	Ah yes, the bite of the San’layn.
VO_ICC05_LichKing_Male_Human_BossBite_03	Beware the terrible hunger. Each turn you must feed!
VO_ICC05_Lanathel_Female_Sanlayn_Wounded_01	Really? Is that all you’ve got?
VO_ICC05_LichKing_Male_Human_Win_01	Lana'thel… It is fortunate you cannot lose stars at your rank.
VO_ICC05_LichKing_Male_Human_Lose_01	Are you afraid to bite your own minions? This is Icecrown. Not NICEcrown! 
VO_ICC05_Lanathel_Female_Sanlayn_EmoteResponse_01	Are you… flirting with me?
VO_ICC05_Lanathel_Female_Sanlayn_LichKing_01	You…!
VO_ICC05_LichKing_Male_Human_LichKing_02	This boss bites.
VO_ICC05_Lanathel_Female_Sanlayn_TransformDK_01	Oh I knew I liked you.
VO_ICC05_Lanathel_Female_Sanlayn_BiteOoze_01	Ohhh you put your MOUTH on that?
VO_ICC05_Lanathel_Female_Sanlayn_BiteSpikes_01	Biting that HAD to hurt.
VO_ICC05_Lanathel_Female_Sanlayn_BiteShell_01	Don’t chip a tooth.
VO_ICC05_Lanathel_Female_Sanlayn_BitePoisonous_01	Be sure to spit out the poison when you’re done.
VO_ICC05_Lanathel_Female_Sanlayn_BloodPrince_01	Betrayer! Turn in your fangs!
VO_ICC05_Lanathel_Female_Sanlayn_PlayerBloodBite_01	You are too late. I am already lost!

VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_HeroPowerInitial_01	Death calls to you…
VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_Intro_01	What is this disturbance? My work here is not complete.
VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_HeroPower_01	The living are so very weak…
VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_HeroPower_02	Your flesh is a curse…
VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_HeroPower_03	Do you grasp the futility of your actions?
VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_HeroPower_04	Darkness embraces you…
VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_DamageByValithria_01	Argh..
VO_ICC10_LichKing_Male_Human_DamageByValithria_02	That dragon will undo all we’ve wrought! Destroy it, Deathwhisper!
VO_ICC10_LichKing_Male_Human_Wounded_01	Stop toying with them and finish this, Deathwhisper.
VO_ICC10_LichKing_Male_Human_Wounded_02	Why isn’t Arcane Explosion in your deck!?
VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_Death_01	Impossible….!
VO_ICC10_LichKing_Male_Human_Turn2_01	Deathwhisper! I told you to finish off that dragon.
VO_ICC10_LichKing_Male_Human_Turn2_02	For the leader of a death cult you’re taking your sweet time.
VO_ICC10_LichKing_Male_Human_Win_01	Your deck has failed me, Deathwhisper. Be content that your defeat was quick.
VO_ICC10_LichKing_Male_Human_Lose_01	Once more. With healing!
VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_EmoteResponse_01	Was that a threat?
VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_Equality_01	That is not the good idea you think it is.
VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_LichKing_01	Master I – please – I’m killing them as fast as I can!
VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_DKTransform_01	Ah! You, too, have tasted the master’s power…
VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_ValithriaResurrect_01	I don’t like this game anymore.
VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_PlayerPlaysEnrage_01	Your minions are gluttons for punishment!
VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_StoneskinGargoyle_01	What? I didn’t know you could play cards from Wild in here!
VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_ValithriaDivineShield_01	Hands off the dragon already!
VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_ValithriaTaunt_01	As if I didn’t hate that dragon enough.
VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_ValithriaWindfury_01	Sickening.
VO_ICC10_Deathwhisper_Female_Lich_ValithriaBlessedChampion_01	Lay your hands elsewhere, Paladin!
VO_ICCA10_001_Female_GreenDragon_Start_01	Help me, champion! I must not... give in.
VO_ICCA10_001_Female_GreenDragon_Healed_01	I am… renewed! 

VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Intro_01	Your suffering will be legendary. Your rank will not.
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Intro_02	In the end, all will serve me.
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Intro_03	You call that wretched pile of cards a deck?
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Intro_04	I am the beginning and the end – I AM THE NEW META.
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Intro_06	You think I’ll have mercy on the likes of you?
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Intro_07	Is that your deck? It looks like a plea for help.
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Intro_08	Your anguished cries will be a testament to my legend-level play.
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Intro_09	Is it truly righteousness that\ndrives you? I wonder…

VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Warrior_01	Warrior. You will make a marvelous Death Knight once I have broken you.
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Shaman_01	Your minions cower in terror before me, Shaman!
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Rogue_01	Come out of the shadows, rogue. Where would you be without your tricks?
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Paladin_01	The Light won't protect you here, paladin. Nothing will protect you...
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Hunter_01	Lonely hunter. Strip away your little friends and what is left to oppose me, hm?
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_GenericStart_03	I will dismantle your deck, and then… YOUR SOUL.
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Warlock_01	Warlock, set aside your pitiful hand. The terrors you command will soon serve ME.
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Mage_01	Mage! I alone, hold sway over the bitter chill of death! 
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Priest_01	Silence, Priest! The Light will be deaf to your cries for mercy.
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_EndOfTurn4_01	No card can forestall my inevitable triumph.
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Turn6_01	That was your most pathetic turn. And you’ve had some bad ones.
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Turn6_03	You play cards the way my Father ran his kingdom. Weakly. 
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Turn6_04	How do you shuffle those cards without feeling sorry for yourself?
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Turn6_05	Each card you play brings you closer to oblivion.
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Turn6_06	Your demise is inevitable, and no emote can express your shame.
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Turn6_07	Who built that deck for you? 
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Turn6_08	Did they think you were fighting Hogger?
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Frostmourne_07	Behold the power of Frostmourne.
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Frostmourne_01	Frostmourne Hungers…
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Frostmourne_02	Frostmourne Hungers… Did you want anything?
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_PhaseTransition_02	Did someone nerf my weapon? 
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Phase03_01	Face now your tragic end.
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Wounded_01	Hope wanes…
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Wounded_02	Impossible… IMPOSSIBLE!
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Death_01	I see… only darkness before me…
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_Lose_03	Join me in the darkness…
VO_ICC08_Tirion_Male_Human_Win_01	You did it, champion!
VO_ICC08_Tirion_Male_Human_Win_02	But without its master's command, the restless Scourge will become an even greater threat to this world.
VO_ICC08_LichKing_Male_Human_EmoteResponse_01	No one orders me around!

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Furbolg_EmoteResponse_01	You are just another… of the voices…
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Furbolg_HeroPower1_01	It calls out…
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Furbolg_HeroPower2_01	These caverns go deep.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Furbolg_HeroPower3_01	Things are not as they seem…
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Furbolg_HeroPower4_01	Who is the monster here?
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Furbolg_HeroPower5_01	You do not see the shadows… but they see you.

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_23h_Male_Furbolg_HeroPower4_01	I know these caves. You know nothing.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_23h_Male_Furbolg_HeroPower5_01	This is MY hunting ground.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_23h_Male_Furbolg_Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_23h_Male_Furbolg_DefeatPlayer_01	Leave the bones as a warning to the others.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_23h_Male_Furbolg_EventPlayBigMinion1_01	The hunt… ends!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_23h_Male_Furbolg_EventPlayBigMinion2_01	There is no escape.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_23h_Male_Furbolg_EventPlayBigMinion3_01	They smell your fear!

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Furbolg_Intro_01	I told you kobolds to - oh - what have we here?
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Furbolg_EmoteResponse_01	That's cold.

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Furbolg_EventFrostMagic3_01	Chilling!

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_42h_Female_Furbolg_Intro_01	Spirits of old! I call upon you.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_42h_Female_Furbolg_EmoteResponse_01	The spirits of old… really don't like you very much.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_42h_Female_Furbolg_Armor5_01	I fight without fear.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_42h_Female_Furbolg_Armor10_01	I give thanks to those that came before.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_42h_Female_Furbolg_Armor15_01	Mighty are the ancients!

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Earthen_EventStatueDestroyed1_01	You prolong the inevitable.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Earthen_EventStatueDestroyed2_01	It is a matter of time.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Earthen_EventStatueDestroyed3_01	You desecrate this place.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Earthen_EventStatueDestroyed4_01	I… must protect… the sanctum…

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_39h_Male_Golem_HeroPower1_01	Crush.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_39h_Male_Golem_HeroPower2_01	Stomp.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_39h_Male_Golem_HeroPower3_01	None may pass!

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_40h_Female_Dragon_EventPlayTwilightWhelp_01	Come back to the fold, little one!

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_43h_Female_Djinn_Intro_01	Your wish is my command… For a price…
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_43h_Female_Djinn_EmoteResponse_01	You'd waste a wish on that?
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_43h_Female_Djinn_HeroAbility1_01	What is your desire?
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_43h_Female_Djinn_HeroAbility2_01	One… Two… Three…
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_43h_Female_Djinn_HeroAbility3_01	Wish granted!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_43h_Female_Djinn_HeroAbilityHandFull1_01	Heheheh.

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_43h_Female_Djinn_HeroAbilityHandFull3_01	Be careful what you wish for.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_43h_Female_Djinn_Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_43h_Female_Djinn_DefeatPlayer_01	Was that not everything you asked for…?

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_44h_Female_Dragon_Intro_01	Feeding time?
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_44h_Female_Dragon_EmoteResponse_01	Not the mamma!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_44h_Female_Dragon_Death_01	<_Death_>

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_25h_Male_Dragon_HeroPower5_01	You can hide no longer.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_25h_Male_Dragon_Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_25h_Male_Dragon_DefeatPlayer_01	These treasures, ancient and venerable. Here they will stay. 
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_25h_Male_Dragon_EventMarinTheFox_01	Marin the Fox! You dare return to this place?

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_26h_Female_Demon_Intro_01	So clever to come so far… let me see you…

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_34h_Male_Demon_Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_34h_Male_Demon_DefeatPlayer_01	I must have more… MORE!

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_49h_Male_Elemental_Intro_01	Your light is dwindling, adventurer…

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_Human_HeroPower1_01	Believe!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_Human_HeroPower2_01	You're healed!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_Human_HeroPower3_01	Turn from the darkness!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_Human_HeroPower4_01	The Light grants mercy.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_Human_HeroPower5_01	Glorious!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_Human_Death_01	It was meant to be…
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_Human_DefeatPlayer_02	I claim these treasures. For the Light! And for me.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_Human_EventOverdraw_01	You never go full Northshire!

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Undead_Intro_01	Hand over the treasure, and I'll kill you quick.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Undead_EmoteResponse_01	Are you new to this dungeon? We're not much for talking here. 
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Undead_HeroPower_01	Behind me!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Undead_HeroPower1_01	Step back.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Undead_HeroPower2_01	Move quick. 
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Undead_HeroPower3_01	In and out of the shadows…
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Undead_HeroPower4_01	Never give them a target.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Undead_Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Undead_DefeatPlayer_01	Now let's see what you had…? Really? You actually chose these cards?

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_37h_Female_BloodElf_Death_01	I'm burning!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_37h_Female_BloodElf_DefeatPlayer_01	You dance in my dungeon, you're going to get burned...
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_37h_Female_BloodElf_EventTheCandle_01	So… YOU took the candle?
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_37h_Female_BloodElf_EventPyroblast_01	Hot hot HOT!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_37h_Female_BloodElf_EventFireball_01	Fire… FIRE! 
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_37h_Female_BloodElf_EventRagnaros_01	Now THIS is my type of fight!

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_15h_Male_Human_Intro_01	Light's sake, Karl! NOW look at where we are! 
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_15h_Male_Human_EmoteResponse_01	Don't I recognize you from Un'goro?
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_15h_Male_Human_TaggedIn1_01	Move aside, I'm taking over.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_15h_Male_Human_TaggedIn2_01	This is ridiculous. Hand me the cards.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_15h_Male_Human_TaggedIn3_01	Step back, it's MY turn!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_15h_Male_Human_Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_15h_Male_Human_PartnerDeath_01	By the Light, you've killed Karl!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_15h_Male_Human_DefeatPlayer_01	Now, maybe if we go THIS way, we'll find our way back to Un'goro.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_32h_Male_Human_EmoteResponse_01	I don't speak to strangers.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_32h_Male_Human_TaggedIn1_01	Let me have a go!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_32h_Male_Human_TaggedIn2_01	Let me help, George!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_32h_Male_Human_TaggedIn3_01	Can I go, George? Can I?
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_32h_Male_Human_Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_32h_Male_Human_PartnerDeath_01	George? Oh no, not George!

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_45h_Male_Gnome_Intro_01	Your pockets are lookin' awful heavy there, bud!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_45h_Male_Gnome_EmoteResponse_01	This place. It's like a maze of twisty little passages. All alike!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_45h_Male_Gnome_HeroPower1_01	Ah, shiny.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_45h_Male_Gnome_HeroPower2_01	Heh heh…
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_45h_Male_Gnome_HeroPower3_01	Heads! I win.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_45h_Male_Gnome_HeroPower4_01	Tails! You lose.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_45h_Male_Gnome_Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_45h_Male_Gnome_DefeatPlayer_01	It's a game of give and take. And I do the taking.

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_54h_Female_Human_Intro_01	<_Whistles distractedly_>
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_54h_Female_Human_EmoteResponse_01	Be right there. Lemme know when the fight starts!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_54h_Female_Human_WakeUp_01	Oh! Are we fighting?
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_54h_Female_Human_Death_01	I wasn't ready!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_54h_Female_Human_DefeatPlayer_01	Okay! I'm ready now.

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_Intro_01	Stay a while, and listen!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_EmoteResponse_01	Oh, a heckler, eh?
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_Song1A_01	You've signed up the best, you're on a great quest…
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_Song1B_01	To find the mighty mother lode!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_Song1C_01	There's treasures galore, but perils in store…
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_Song1D_01	And construction that's not quite up to code!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_Song2A_01	But if you steal their light, then you must take flight
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_Song2B_01	Eluding each hazard and each trap.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_Song2C_01	It's a chaotic race, as the monsters give chase…
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_Song2D_01	And all the while you're trying to follow the map.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_Song3A_01	They're gaining on you, your options are few…
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_Song3B_01	And you fear that you'll never get to home.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_Song3C_01	You've sought after wealth, will you lose all your health?
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_Song3D_01	To the Kobolds & Catacombs!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_KillingBlowReady_01	Kobolds & Catacombs!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_Death_01	Goodnight Azeroth!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_DefeatPlayer_02	Thanks for your minions, friend!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_StealDoomsayer_01	Worst. Roadie. Ever!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_StealMinstrel_01	Time for a duet!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_EventBoombox_01	Oh hey! Turn that thing down!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_Steal_01	Get over here!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_Steal_02	Come here.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_51h_Male_Dwarf_Steal_03	It's time to party!

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_53h2_Female_Undead_Intro_01	Time can be unwound. You can be undone.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_53h2_Female_Undead_EmoteResponse_01	I have outfoxed bronze dragons. You pose no threat.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_53h2_Female_Undead_TimeRewindStart1_01	Behold my discovery!

VO_LOOTA_BOSS_53h2_Female_Undead_TimeRewindStart4_01	This is my moment!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_53h2_Female_Undead_TimeRewindPlayCard1_01	I get better every time.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_53h2_Female_Undead_TimeRewindPlayCard2_01	We've done this before.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_53h2_Female_Undead_TimeRewindPlayCard3_01	Time is on my side.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_53h2_Female_Undead_TimeRewindPlayCard4_01	She who controls time, controls the infinite!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_53h2_Female_Undead_TimeRewindPlayCard5_01	Time to finish this!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_53h2_Female_Undead_RitualPrep1_01	Your time will come…
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_53h2_Female_Undead_RitualPrep2_01	My power gathers.
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_53h2_Female_Undead_RitualPrep3_01	Tick tock…
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_53h2_Female_Undead_Death_01	Paradox!
VO_LOOTA_BOSS_53h2_Female_Undead_DefeatPlayer_01	I knew I would win. I've seen my own future.

VO_GILA_BOSS_45h_Female_Human_EventFirstDamage_01	Does this mean you're not in?
VO_GILA_BOSS_45h_Female_Human_EventPlayHallowedWater_01	Hallowed water? Ugh. Never could stand the taste.

VO_GILA_BOSS_68h_Male_Undead_Intro_01	Bring out your dead! I need them.
VO_GILA_BOSS_68h_Male_Undead_EmoteResponse_01	Do you know how difficult it is to MAKE a plague?

VO_GILA_BOSS_67h_Male_Undead_EmoteResponse_01	Not another squeak out of you!
VO_GILA_BOSS_67h_Male_Undead_DefeatPlayer_01	Life is nothing but a rat race.
VO_GILA_BOSS_67h_Male_Undead_EventPlayRat_01	They make fine pets, don't they? Even better in a stew.
VO_GILA_BOSS_67h_Male_Undead_EventPlayRat_02	Such simple little creatures. Just like you.
VO_GILA_BOSS_67h_Male_Undead_EventPlayRat_03	Careful, those nibbles aren't love bites.
VO_GILA_BOSS_67h_Male_Undead_EventPlayRatTrap_01	A box? A stick? You lack subtlety!

VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Male_NightElf_Intro_01	Turn back, intruder.
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Male_NightElf_EmoteResponse_02	Your words can't sway me.
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Male_NightElf_Death_01	No…
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Male_NightElf_DefeatPlayer_01	The Witchwood has no use for you.
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Male_NightElf_HeroPower_01	Survival of the fittest!
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Male_NightElf_HeroPower_02	By root and stalk.

VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Male_NightElf_EventHack_03	Get... Out… of… these… woods!

VO_GILA_BOSS_40h_Female_Treant_Intro_01	Your kind will pay.
VO_GILA_BOSS_40h_Female_Treant_EmoteResponse_01	Chop. Chop.
VO_GILA_BOSS_40h_Female_Treant_Death_01	Felled...
VO_GILA_BOSS_40h_Female_Treant_DefeatPlayer_01	One of many to come. My harvest begins.
VO_GILA_BOSS_40h_Female_Treant_HeroPower_01	The forest claims them. 
VO_GILA_BOSS_40h_Female_Treant_HeroPower_02	These woods are alive.
VO_GILA_BOSS_40h_Female_Treant_HeroPower_03	Come. It is our time.
VO_GILA_BOSS_40h_Female_Treant_HeroPower_04	You will know our hatred.
VO_GILA_BOSS_40h_Female_Treant_EventPlaysWoodsmansAxe_01	Abhorrant. 
VO_GILA_BOSS_40h_Female_Treant_EventPlaysAxe_01	So many, cut down in their prime.
VO_GILA_BOSS_40h_Female_Treant_EventPlaysAxe_02	How many of my kind must suffer?

VO_GILA_BOSS_36h_Female_Human_Intro_01	Oh no, not again.
VO_GILA_BOSS_36h_Female_Human_Emote Response_01	Enough talking. Pucker up, dearie!
VO_GILA_BOSS_36h_Female_Human_Death_01	Croak!
VO_GILA_BOSS_36h_Female_Human_DefeatPlayer_01	You're clearly not my Prince!
VO_GILA_BOSS_36h_Female_Human_HeroPower_01	Smooches!
VO_GILA_BOSS_36h_Female_Human_HeroPower_02	<_Kiss_>
VO_GILA_BOSS_36h_Female_Human_HeroPower_03	Mwah!
VO_GILA_BOSS_36h_Female_Human_EventHex_01	Oh my! So… charming!
VO_GILA_BOSS_36h_Female_Human_EventHex_02	Darling I know how that feels.

VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_IntroShaw_01	I will turn your dogs against their master.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_IntroTess_01	Turn back, "Princess." Tell your father there's no hope.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_IntroCrowley_01	It will be a blessed quiet when I silence that gun.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_IntroToki_01	You bend your fate, but the trees and stars remember.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EmoteResponse_01	Look upon your reflection, and see the agent of your end.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EmoteResponseTess_01	Did your parents have any children they loved?
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EmoteResponseCrowley_01	What are you compensating for, Crowley?
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EmoteResponseShaw_01	Yip, yip, yap, yap. And your dogs are irritating, too.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EmoteResponseToki_01	How did you escape the gnome-napper?
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_DefeatPlayer_01	I am one with these woods, and I will never die.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventTessTurn2_01	These woods will claim your city. 
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventTessTurn4_01	This land was DEAD! I brought it to life. It’s MINE.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventTessScavenges_01	Nothing will save you.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventTessScavenges_02	Keep digging, Princess.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventTessScavenges_03	Picking through the trash?
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventTessScavenges_04	You’ll find no solace in the reeds.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventTessHagathaLow_01	I AM these woods. 
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventTessLow_01	Your remains will feed this forest.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventCrowleyTurn2_01	You abandoned this land! I reclaimed it!
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventCrowleyTurn4_01	You’re an outcast, even among your own.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventCannonKill_01	A curse on that cannon!
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventCannonKill_02	You are loud. Not smart.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventCannonKill_03	Iron rusts just as flesh rots.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventCannonKill_04	Your bark is loud, mutt.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventCrowleyHagathaLow_01	I will never die, so long as these woods live…
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventCrowleyLow_01	I’ll bury you with your cannon, Crowley.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventShawTurn2_01	All creatures of the forest become mine…
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventShawTurn2_02	Once they feel my touch.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventShawTurn4_01	A thousand dark spirits are arrayed against you. 
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventShawHoundKill_01	Bad dog.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventShawHoundKill_02	Filthy mutts.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventShawLow_01	The curse of the Witchwood claims you.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventTokiTurn2_01	You’re as much an abomination as me, gnome.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventTokiTurn4_01	You think your\nmachinations invisible.\nI see everything.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventTokiHeroPower_01	…what just happened?
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventTokiHeroPower_03	You press your luck.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventTokiHeroPower_04	The spirits see what you do. 
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventTokiHeroPower_05	One day your tricks will catch up to you.
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventTokiHagathaLow_01	The spirits of these woods will preserve me…
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventTokiLow_01	You have no tricks left, gnome. 
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventSummonCrowskin_01	My cult will never die. 
VO_GILA_BOSS_61h_Female_Orc_EventSummonGodfrey_01	Godfrey, the spirits of this wood call you back…

VO_GILA_500h3_Female_Human_EVENT_HAGATHA_SUB_IN_01	Get behind cover! I'll finish this. 
VO_GILA_500h3_Female_Human_EVENT_HAGATHA_TURN2_01	Gilneas has weathered worse than you, Hagatha. 
VO_GILA_500h3_Female_Human_EVENT_HAGATHA_TURN4_01	Leave this place, witch!
VO_GILA_500h3_Female_Human_EVENT_HAGATHA_WOUNDED_01	Leave these woods, and I will let you live.
VO_GILA_600h_Male_Worgen_EVENT_HAGATHA_SUB_IN_01	I've got you in my sights, Hagatha.
VO_GILA_600h_Male_Worgen_EVENT_HAGATHA_TURN2_01	This land belongs to the Gilneans.
VO_GILA_600h_Male_Worgen_EVENT_HAGATHA_TURN4_01	At least I HAVE a people.
VO_GILA_600h_Male_Worgen_EVENT_HAGATHA_WOUNDED_01	I’ll blast every tree. I’ll leave these woods a crater.
VO_GILA_400h_Male_Human_EVENT_HAGATHA_INTRO_01	My dogs found her! Hagatha is here!
VO_GILA_400h_Male_Human_EVENT_HAGATHA_TURN4_01	I got dogs. 
VO_GILA_400h_Male_Human_EVENT_HAGATHA_LOWHEALTH_01	She’s wounded. Follow the trail, boys.

VO_GILA_900h_Female_Gnome_EVENT_HAGATHA_TURN2_01	I’ve moved heaven and earth to take you out.
VO_GILA_900h_Female_Gnome_EVENT_HAGATHA_WOUNDED_01	Your time is almost up, witch. 
VO_GILA_900h_Female_Gnome_EVENT_HAGATHA_ALMOST_DEAD_01	Time heals all wounds.

VO_GILA_BOSS_51h_Male_Undead_Intro_01	You look like someone who owes me money.
VO_GILA_BOSS_51h_Male_Undead_EmoteResponse_01	Bite your tongue.
VO_GILA_BOSS_51h_Male_Undead_Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_GILA_BOSS_51h_Male_Undead_DefeatPlayer_01	Ohh! Looks like you won't be needing that gold anymore.
VO_GILA_BOSS_51h_Male_Undead_HeroPower_01	A drop in the bucket.
VO_GILA_BOSS_51h_Male_Undead_HeroPower_02	You pay what you owe.
VO_GILA_BOSS_51h_Male_Undead_HeroPower_03	A pittance, really.
VO_GILA_BOSS_51h_Male_Undead_HeroPower_04	Empty. Your. Pockets.
VO_GILA_BOSS_51h_Male_Undead_EventPlayMinion_01	Oi! There's a tax on that.
VO_GILA_BOSS_51h_Male_Undead_EventPlayMinion_03	That'll cost you.
VO_GILA_BOSS_51h_Male_Undead_EventPlayMinion_04	You'll pay for that. Soon enough.

VO_GILA_BOSS_43h_Male_HumanGhost_EventPlaysDeathrattle_02	The dead have tales to tell.
VO_GILA_BOSS_43h_Male_HumanGhost_EventPlaysDeathrattle_03	We're not so different.
VO_GILA_BOSS_43h_Male_HumanGhost_EventPlaysDeathrattle_04	Climb in. Find rest.
VO_GILA_BOSS_43h_Male_HumanGhost_EventPlaysDeathrattle_05	A shallow grave for that one.
VO_GILA_BOSS_43h_Male_HumanGhost_EventPlayStrokeOfMidnight_01	How I've missed the ringing of bells.

VO_GILA_BOSS_29h_Female_Satyr_HeroPower_05	I'll take care of you! Trust me.
VO_GILA_BOSS_29h_Female_Satyr_EventPlaysSmallMinion_01	Aren't you just adorable?
VO_GILA_BOSS_29h_Female_Satyr_EventPlaysSmallMinion_02	You're almost as charming as me! Well…
VO_GILA_BOSS_29h_Female_Satyr_EventPlaysSmallMinion_03	I could just eat you up!
VO_GILA_BOSS_29h_Female_Satyr_EventPlaysEnchantingTune_01	Do you find my tune alluring?
VO_GILA_BOSS_29h_Female_Satyr_EventPlaysEnchantingTune_02	Can't we all just get along?
VO_GILA_BOSS_29h_Female_Satyr_EventPlaysEnchantingTune_03	Take a seat by me! I won't bite.
VO_GILA_BOSS_29h_Female_Satyr_EventPlaysOldMilitiaHorn_01	A duet?

VO_GILA_BOSS_46h_Male_Worgen_Intro_01	Still you try to hunt me?
VO_GILA_BOSS_46h_Male_Worgen_EmoteResponse_01	Do you smell that? Fear.
VO_GILA_BOSS_46h_Male_Worgen_DefeatPlayer_01	Only the strongest survive.
VO_GILA_BOSS_46h_Male_Worgen_EventPlaysWorgen_01	Pitiful.
VO_GILA_BOSS_46h_Male_Worgen_EventPlaysWorgen_03	Weakling.
VO_GILA_BOSS_46h_Male_Worgen_EventPlaysWorgen_06	You are nothing.
VO_GILA_BOSS_46h_Male_Worgen_EventPlayTrapper_02	Succumb to your rage!
VO_GILA_BOSS_46h_Male_Worgen_EventPlayBloodMoon_01	AHWOOOO!

VO_GILA_BOSS_30h_Female_Gnome_Intro_01	Care for a bite?
VO_GILA_BOSS_30h_Female_Gnome_EmoteResponse_01	Oh it's too late now.
VO_GILA_BOSS_30h_Female_Gnome_DefeatPlayer_01	There's no such thing as a free meal, dear.
VO_GILA_BOSS_30h_Female_Gnome_EventBloodMagic_01	So fragile. So frail.
VO_GILA_BOSS_30h_Female_Gnome_EventBloodMagic_02	Take a bite.
VO_GILA_BOSS_30h_Female_Gnome_EventBloodMagic_04	Toodaloo.
VO_GILA_BOSS_30h_Female_Gnome_EventBloodMagic_05	All are equal before my magic.
VO_GILA_BOSS_30h_Female_Gnome_EventBloodMagic_06	Tasty, no?

VO_GILA_BOSS_42h_Male_Ogre_Intro_01	Who's there? I can smell you!
VO_GILA_BOSS_42h_Male_Ogre_EmoteResponse_01	Keep talking and I will keep stepping!
VO_GILA_BOSS_42h_Male_Ogre_DefeatPlayer_01	You never saw it coming. Neither did I.
VO_GILA_BOSS_42h_Male_Ogre_EventHeroPowerFriendly_01	That wasn't right.
VO_GILA_BOSS_42h_Male_Ogre_EventHeroPowerFriendly_02	Something bad went crunch.
VO_GILA_BOSS_42h_Male_Ogre_EventHeroPowerEnemy_01	Gotcha! 
VO_GILA_BOSS_42h_Male_Ogre_EventHeroPowerEnemy_02	Smash!
VO_GILA_BOSS_42h_Male_Ogre_EventHeroPowerEnemy_03	I never miss!

VO_GILA_BOSS_54h_Male_Golem_Intro_01	A rolling stone gathers no moss.
VO_GILA_BOSS_54h_Male_Golem_EmoteResponse_01	Sticks and stones.
VO_GILA_BOSS_54h_Male_Golem_DefeatPlayer_01	Bend and snap. Crush and shatter.
VO_GILA_BOSS_54h_Male_Golem_HeroPower_01	All will belong.
VO_GILA_BOSS_54h_Male_Golem_HeroPower_02	The Witchwood spreads.
VO_GILA_BOSS_54h_Male_Golem_HeroPower_03	Raze the earth. Spread the seeds.
VO_GILA_BOSS_54h_Male_Golem_HeroPower_04	Hagatha's embrace makes us stronger.
VO_GILA_BOSS_54h_Male_Golem_HeroPower_05	By Hagatha's will.

VO_GILA_BOSS_52h_Male_Human_IntroALT_02	Burglar?! Me? Well I never…
VO_GILA_BOSS_52h_Male_Human_EmoteResponse_02	It's all ashes and smoke down there.
VO_GILA_BOSS_52h_Male_Human_DefeatPlayerALT_02	I ain't goin' back to jail! Not today!
VO_GILA_BOSS_52h_Male_Human_HeroPower_01	Unseen!
VO_GILA_BOSS_52h_Male_Human_HeroPower_02	It's not sneaking, I swear!
VO_GILA_BOSS_52h_Male_Human_HeroPower_03	City camouflage right here.
VO_GILA_BOSS_52h_Male_Human_HeroPower_04	Just a touch of soot.
VO_GILA_BOSS_52h_Male_Human_HeroPower_05	Powdered up!
VO_GILA_BOSS_52h_Male_Human_EventPlayStealth_02	Double standards!
VO_GILA_BOSS_52h_Male_Human_EventPlayStealth_03	Oh, and sneaking about makes ME the thief?
VO_GILA_BOSS_52h_Male_Human_EventPlayRoyalGift_02	Oooh, shiny! Wouldn't mind getting me hands on that.
VO_GILA_BOSS_52h_Male_Human_EventTransform_01	Now you've gone and done it.
VO_GILA_BOSS_52h2_Male_Worgen_EmoteResponse_02	Now look whatcha made me do!
VO_GILA_BOSS_52h2_Male_Worgen_HeroPower_01	AHWOOOO!
VO_GILA_BOSS_52h2_Male_Worgen_HeroPower_02	Get 'em!
VO_GILA_BOSS_52h2_Male_Worgen_HeroPower_03	Feel the beast within!

VO_GILA_BOSS_64h_Male_Goblin_Intro_01	Oh! A volunteer? 
VO_GILA_BOSS_64h_Male_Goblin_EmoteResponse_01	I do love audience participation.
VO_GILA_BOSS_64h_Male_Goblin_Death_01	W-wait!
VO_GILA_BOSS_64h_Male_Goblin_DefeatPlayer_01	Thank you, thank you! Now for my payment…
VO_GILA_BOSS_64h_Male_Goblin_HeroPowerHandEmpty_01	Zzzz... Zzzz...
VO_GILA_BOSS_64h_Male_Goblin_HeroPowerHandSmall_01	What was I doing again?
VO_GILA_BOSS_64h_Male_Goblin_HeroPowerHandSmall_02	You're… getting tired.
VO_GILA_BOSS_64h_Male_Goblin_HeroPowerHandMedium_01	Look into my eyes.
VO_GILA_BOSS_64h_Male_Goblin_HeroPowerHandMedium_02	Follow my watch… Wait… What was next in the book?
VO_GILA_BOSS_64h_Male_Goblin_HeroPowerHandMedium_03	Back and forth. Watch it sway!
VO_GILA_BOSS_64h_Male_Goblin_HeroPowerHandBig_01	You're getting sleepy.
VO_GILA_BOSS_64h_Male_Goblin_HeroPowerHandBig_03	Your eyelids are so heavy, you can't keep them up!
VO_GILA_BOSS_64h_Male_Goblin_EventMCTech_01	Whoa hey! That's my schtick!
VO_GILA_BOSS_64h_Male_Goblin_EventMindControl_01	Trying to one-up me eh?
VO_GILA_BOSS_64h_Male_Goblin_EvenPlayCursedCurio_01	That's gorgeous! Where can I get one?

VO_GILA_BOSS_63h_Female_Harpy_Intro_01	You go no farther. Hagatha commands it!
VO_GILA_BOSS_63h_Female_Harpy_EmoteResponse_01	I feel further conversation at this time clouds our relationship dynamic. 
VO_GILA_BOSS_63h_Female_Harpy_Death_01	My… Eggs…
VO_GILA_BOSS_63h_Female_Harpy_DefeatPlayer_01	Sisters! Bring the remains to my nest.
VO_GILA_BOSS_63h_Female_Harpy_HeroPower_01	Mine!
VO_GILA_BOSS_63h_Female_Harpy_HeroPower_02	Your magic only darkens this wood.
VO_GILA_BOSS_63h_Female_Harpy_HeroPower_03	I only grow stronger, fool. 

VO_GILA_BOSS_34h_Male_Demon_Intro_01	Soon you will be but a shallow husk.
VO_GILA_BOSS_34h_Male_Demon_EmoteResponse_01	Hopefully your soul isn't as… talkative.
VO_GILA_BOSS_34h_Male_Demon_DefeatPlayer_01	Your soul is… powerful. I will feast for weeks!
VO_GILA_BOSS_34h_Male_Demon_HeroPower_01	Ambrosia.
VO_GILA_BOSS_34h_Male_Demon_HeroPower_02	Delectable.
VO_GILA_BOSS_34h_Male_Demon_HeroPower_03	You're looking a little pale.
VO_GILA_BOSS_34h_Male_Demon_HeroPower_04	Let me take that weight off your shoulders.
VO_GILA_BOSS_34h_Male_Demon_HeroPower_05	A soul is nothing more than a burden.

VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_Intro_02	Have you come for my Gnomes?
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_IntroToki_02	Oh, another one for my collection…
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EmoteResponse_01	I won't share!
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EmoteResponseToki_01	Hmm... Another chatty one…
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_Death_01	My… Gnomes…
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_DeathToki_01	The... irony!
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_DefeatPlayer_01	I don't think you'll fit in my bag.
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_DefeatPlayerToki_01	Nothing beats adding a rare Gnome to your collection.
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EventSackOfGnomes_01	I forgot what I put in here.
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EventSackOfGnomes_03	I've got too many to count!
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EventSackOfGnomes_04	What do we have in here.
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EventSackOfGnomes_05	These ones are left over.
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EventPlaysGnome_01	I've got one of those! …Somewhere.
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EventPlaysGnome_02	That one's pretty rare!
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EventPlaysGnome_05	You've got good taste. 
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EventPlaysGnome_06	I'll be adding that one to my collection.
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EventPlaysLeper_01	This one is kind of icky.
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EventPlaysClockwork_02	Older model, hard to come by these days.
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EventPlaysMillhouse_02	This one never shuts up!
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EventPlaysThermaplugg_02	Maximum Gnome value!
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EventSilence_03	Quiet now…
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EventBurgle_01	Got any Gnomes in there?
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EventBurgle_03	Is that a Gnome in your pocket?
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EventPlayGattlingGunner_01	Where'd you find that one?
VO_GILA_BOSS_26h_Male_Tauren_EventPlayClockworkAssistant_01	That's a low-quality knock-off. 

VO_GILA_BOSS_47h_Male_Monster_IntroALT_01	Who walks on pox'd rocks where stalks the Shudderwock?
VO_GILA_BOSS_47h_Male_Monster_EmoteResponse_01	It speaks! It bleats! So weak it seeks relief from beasts that feast.
VO_GILA_BOSS_47h_Male_Monster_Death_01	My run... is done!
VO_GILA_BOSS_47h_Male_Monster_DefeatPlayer_01	With each hero devoured, these woods are empowered.
VO_GILA_BOSS_47h_Male_Monster_HeroPower_01	Trouble, doubled!
VO_GILA_BOSS_47h_Male_Monster_HeroPower_02	Pay the price, not once, but twice.
VO_GILA_BOSS_47h_Male_Monster_HeroPower_03	We meet, we greet. A treat? Repeat.

VO_GILA_BOSS_27h_Male_Construct_Intro_01	Nice to bleat you.
VO_GILA_BOSS_27h_Male_Construct_EmoteResponse_01	Excuse me I do that sometimes.
VO_GILA_BOSS_27h_Male_Construct_Death_02	We… finally escaped!
VO_GILA_BOSS_27h_Male_Construct_DefeatPlayer_01	You were… not my target.
VO_GILA_BOSS_27h_Male_Construct_HeroPowerMurloc_01	…more fish…
VO_GILA_BOSS_27h_Male_Construct_HeroPowerBeast_02	…a beast within me…
VO_GILA_BOSS_27h_Male_Construct_HeroPowerPirate_01	…yar?
VO_GILA_BOSS_27h_Male_Construct_HeroPowerDragon_01	…such a magnificent creature…
VO_GILA_BOSS_27h_Male_Construct_HeroPowerMech_02	…a clockwork heart!
VO_GILA_BOSS_27h_Male_Construct_HeroPowerDemon_01	…such darkness…
VO_GILA_BOSS_27h_Male_Construct_HeroPowerGeneric_01	…another…
VO_GILA_BOSS_27h_Male_Construct_EventPlayDrBoom_02	Dr. Boom?! Don't take me back to the lab!
VO_GILA_BOSS_27h_Male_Construct_EventPlayUnstablePortal_01	The lab… In Netherstorm…
VO_GILA_BOSS_27h_Male_Construct_EventPlaySparePart_01	There were many such parts… in the lab…

VO_GILA_BOSS_55h_Female_NightElf_Intro_01	Hagatha's curse devours. I must save my children!
VO_GILA_BOSS_55h_Female_NightElf_EmoteResponse_01	Shush! Not in front of the wisps.
VO_GILA_BOSS_55h_Female_NightElf_Death_01	Who will save them?
VO_GILA_BOSS_55h_Female_NightElf_DefeatPlayer_01	Hush now. I will usher your spirit to safety…
VO_GILA_BOSS_55h_Female_NightElf_HeroPower_01	Come, children.
VO_GILA_BOSS_55h_Female_NightElf_HeroPower_02	Ah, there you are.
VO_GILA_BOSS_55h_Female_NightElf_HeroPower_03	Come out, come out…
VO_GILA_BOSS_55h_Female_NightElf_EventKillsWisp_02	No!
VO_GILA_BOSS_55h_Female_NightElf_EventKillsWisp_03	Stop!
VO_GILA_BOSS_55h_Female_NightElf_EventKillsWisp_04	My children!
VO_GILA_BOSS_55h_Female_NightElf_EventAssimilation_01	What's yours, will become ours.
VO_GILA_BOSS_55h_Female_NightElf_EventAssimilation_02	Their bodies - get them!
VO_GILA_BOSS_55h_Female_NightElf_EventAssimilation_03	Here is our chance!
VO_GILA_BOSS_55h_Female_NightElf_EventPlayCompass_01	Perhaps that will help us find our way out.
VO_GILA_BOSS_55h_Female_NightElf_EventPlayCartographer_01	A map maker! She must know the way out.

VO_GILA_BOSS_56h_Male_Elemental_IntroALT_02	We're not so different, you and I.
VO_GILA_BOSS_56h_Male_Elemental_EmoteResponse_01	I couldn't have said it better myself.
VO_GILA_BOSS_56h_Male_Elemental_DefeatPlayer_01	Why must your face look so sad? Ah, well. 
VO_GILA_BOSS_56h_Male_Elemental_HeroPower_01	A new mask, a new face.
VO_GILA_BOSS_56h_Male_Elemental_HeroPower_02	A new face, a new person.
VO_GILA_BOSS_56h_Male_Elemental_HeroPower_03	A new person, a new life.
VO_GILA_BOSS_56h_Male_Elemental_HeroPower_05	Always changing, always shifting.
VO_GILA_BOSS_56h_Male_Elemental_HeroPower_07	We are one, we are all.
VO_GILA_BOSS_56h_Male_Elemental_HeroPower_09	Can you even remember who you were?
VO_GILA_BOSS_56h_Male_Elemental_HeroPower_10	A mask is all you need.
VO_GILA_BOSS_56h_Male_Elemental_EventTransformFace_02	Ah, the perfect mask.

VO_GILA_BOSS_37h_Male_Murloc_Intro_01	…
VO_GILA_BOSS_37h_Male_Murloc_EmoteResponse_01	…!
VO_GILA_BOSS_37h_Male_Murloc_DefeatPlayer_01	...
VO_GILA_BOSS_37h_Male_Murloc_HeroPower_01	…
VO_GILA_BOSS_37h_Male_Murloc_HeroPower_02	…
VO_GILA_BOSS_37h_Male_Murloc_HeroPower_03	…!
VO_GILA_BOSS_37h_Male_Murloc_HeroPower_04	…
VO_GILA_BOSS_37h_Male_Murloc_EventPlayPlague_01	…!
VO_GILA_BOSS_37h_Male_Murloc_EventPlayPlague_02	…!
VO_GILA_BOSS_37h_Male_Murloc_EventPlayPlague_07	…!
VO_GILA_BOSS_37h_Male_Murloc_EventPlayMurlocHolmes_02	…? …!

VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Female_HumanGhost_Intro_01	I'll be with you again soon, my love.
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Female_HumanGhost_EmoteResponse_01	Leave us be.
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Female_HumanGhost_Death_01	My darling…
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Female_HumanGhost_DefeatPlayer_01	Nothing can tear us apart.
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Female_HumanGhost_EventShuffle_01	You understand us... don't you?
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Female_HumanGhost_EventShuffle_02	Together… forever.
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Female_HumanGhost_EventShuffle_03	You're just like us.
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Female_HumanGhost_HeroPower_01	I'm never letting go.
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Female_HumanGhost_HeroPower_02	Come back to me!
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Female_HumanGhost_HeroPower_03	Don't go…
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Female_HumanGhost_HeroPower_04	I will keep you close.
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Female_HumanGhost_EventFatigue_01	My love? Where did you go?
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Female_HumanGhost_EventFatigue_02	I can't feel his presence anymore…
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Female_HumanGhost_EventFatigueDeath_01	Are we… finally free? Thank you!
VO_GILA_BOSS_41h_Female_HumanGhost_EventPlayRin_01	Will she be the one to free us?

VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_Intro_01	Ah, we meet again! For the first time!
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_Intro_02	Me again? This is the second time we've fought. 
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_Intro_03	This is the third time we've fought. Give up!
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_Intro_04	You keep… coming back! Stop it!
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_Intro_05	How many times must we do this dance?
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_EmoteResponse_01	I knew I was going to say that. 
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_Death_01	This'll hurt you more than it hurts me!
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_DefeatPlayer_01	Well, that takes care of ME. Wait - is this a paradox?
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_HeroPower_01	Time to speed things up!
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_HeroPower_02	Tick tock tick tock!
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_HeroPower_03	Let's get this over with.
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_PlayerHeroPower_01	Why did I think that was a good idea?
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_PlayerHeroPower_02	I used to think I was so clever.
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_PlayerHeroPower_03	Not again!
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_PlayerHeroPower_04	I'm REALLY getting on my nerves.
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_EventAlt_01	No! We're doing this again.
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_EventAlt_02	I think it went more like… this!
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_EventAlt_03	Stop! Rewind that.
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_EventPlayerAltTime_01	Well, that's a first.
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_EventPlayerAltTime_02	Wow, we really HAVE screwed up the timeline.
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_EventTimeWarp_01	You'll learn this one in a couple years.
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_EventTimeWarp_02	It was tough to figure this out.
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_EventPlayerTimeWarpToki_01	Wait you're not supposed to know that yet!
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_EventPlayerTimeWarpToki_02	I remember this part from the last time I did it!
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_EventPlayerTimeWarp_01	This is just getting confusing.
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_EventPlayerTimeWarp_02	Note to self: Avoid this fight.
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_EventTurn2_01	I've got to stop me! Before I'm too late!
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_EventTurn4_01	You can't possibly win, I know my every move!
VO_GILA_BOSS_48h_Female_Gnome_EventTurn6_01	We both regret what you do next. Unless I stop you! 
VO_GILA_900h_Female_Gnome_EVENT_NEMESIS_INTRO_B_01	Has this… happened before?
VO_GILA_900h_Female_Gnome_EVENT_NEMESIS_TURN2_02	Just what do I think I'm doing!?
VO_GILA_900h_Female_Gnome_EVENT_NEMESIS_TURN6_01	You're from the future? Which of us wins?

VO_GILA_BOSS_60h_Male_HumanGhost_IntroTess_01	Aye! It be the daughter o' the King that done us in. 
VO_GILA_BOSS_60h_Male_HumanGhost_EmoteResponseTess_01	You best start believin' in ghost stories, missy.
VO_GILA_BOSS_60h_Male_HumanGhost_Death_02	Washed… away…
VO_GILA_BOSS_60h_Male_HumanGhost_DefeatPlayer_01	Welcome aboard. Forever!
VO_GILA_BOSS_60h_Male_HumanGhost_HeroPower_01	My blade sings to me, and I sing back!
VO_GILA_BOSS_60h_Male_HumanGhost_HeroPower_07	Drown out the waves!
VO_GILA_BOSS_60h_Male_HumanGhost_EventPlayPatches_02	Patches! You've lost a few eyes, me old friend!
VO_GILA_BOSS_60h_Male_HumanGhost_EventPlayKragg_02	Abandoned the sea for the sky? What a fool.
VO_GILA_BOSS_60h_Male_HumanGhost_EventPlayKingsblade_01	I searched the world for this beauty.
VO_GILA_BOSS_60h_Male_HumanGhost_EventPlayKingsblade_02	She'll always come back to me.
VO_GILA_BOSS_60h_Male_HumanGhost_EventPlayerKingsblade_01	Wait… there's more than one?
VO_GILA_BOSS_60h_Male_HumanGhost_EventBigWeapon_01	Nice and sharp.
VO_GILA_BOSS_60h_Male_HumanGhost_EventBigWeapon_02	What a beauty she is.
VO_GILA_BOSS_60h_Male_HumanGhost_EventBigWeapon_03	Ever seen a blade as nice as this?
VO_GILA_BOSS_60h_Male_HumanGhost_EventPlayTuskarrRaider_01	They'll let anyone be a pirate these days.
VO_GILA_BOSS_60h_Male_HumanGhost_EventTurn2_01	What better\nvengeance than\nto claim you\nfor my crew?
VO_GILA_500h3_Female_Human_EVENT_NEMESIS_INTRO_01	Shivers. I thought you were dead.
VO_GILA_500h3_Female_Human_EVENT_NEMESIS_TURN2_01	I'll finish what my father started.

VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_Intro_02	Have you tracked us? Or have we lured you here?
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EmoteResponse_01	Join our cult. We have pot-luck Fridays. 
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_Death_01	A rotten… heart…
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_DefeatPlayer_01	You could've joined us. 
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventPlayFaithful_01	Come my children. 
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventPlayFaithful_02	Step forward, my faithful…
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventPlayFaithful_03	Grant me your life.
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventPlayFaithful_04	My grateful followers!
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventPlayFaithful_05	Serve me one last time!
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventPact_01	Join us…
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventPact_02	Another one joins the fold!
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventPact_03	Come to me, yes…
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventPact_05	My cult grows!
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventFaithfulDies_01	I needed that one!
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventFaithfulDies_02	Good help is hard to mind control.
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventFaithfulDies_03	I will not forget you... whatever your name was!
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventPlayTreant_01	Stir it with some rotted\nwood. Then the charm is firm and good.
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventPlayBird_01	Peacebloom thorn\nand Redband's sting.\nLizard's leg and\nowlet wing.
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventPlayCauldron_01	Double, double, toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventPlayHex_01	Eye of newt and toe of frog. Wool of bat and touch of fog.
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventPlaySnake_01	Fillet of a poison snake. In the cauldron boil and bake.
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventPlayDragon_01	Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf. Stem of Earthroot, stew engulf.
VO_GILA_BOSS_49h_Female_Undead_EventTurn02_01	If you knew her power, Shaw, you'd heel like your dogs.
VO_GILA_400h_Male_Human_EVENT_NEMESIS_INTRO_01	I've tracked you down at last, Crowskin!
VO_GILA_400h_Male_Human_EVENT_NEMESIS_TURN2_01	Why? Why did you cast your lot with Hagatha?

VO_GILA_BOSS_59h_Male_Undead_Intro_01	Your journey ends in agony!
VO_GILA_BOSS_59h_Male_Undead_IntroCrowley_01	You're one to talk about loyalty, Crowley. 
VO_GILA_BOSS_59h_Male_Undead_EmoteResponse_01	You brought a cannon to a gun fight?\nWho's the coward?
VO_GILA_BOSS_59h_Male_Undead_DefeatPlayer_01	Still, you're nothing more than a wretched mongrel.
VO_GILA_BOSS_59h_Male_Undead_DefeatPlayer_02	Goodbye, old friend.
VO_GILA_BOSS_59h_Male_Undead_DefeatPlayer_03	This is the assassin sent to kill me? Laughable.
VO_GILA_BOSS_59h_Male_Undead_HeroPowerKills_01	This really brings me back.
VO_GILA_BOSS_59h_Male_Undead_HeroPowerKills_02	I forgot how good this feels!
VO_GILA_BOSS_59h_Male_Undead_HeroPowerKills_03	Ahhahaha.
VO_GILA_BOSS_59h_Male_Undead_HeroPowerKills_04	Ahaha! To watch the world burn.
VO_GILA_BOSS_59h_Male_Undead_HeroPowerKills_05	If only could I could do this to every last Worgen.
VO_GILA_BOSS_59h_Male_Undead_EventQuickShot_01	I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.
VO_GILA_BOSS_59h_Male_Undead_EventQuickShot_02	Draw!
VO_GILA_BOSS_59h_Male_Undead_EventDeadlyShot_01	Bullseye!
VO_GILA_BOSS_59h_Male_Undead_EventDeadlyShot_02	What? It was a mercy killing.
VO_GILA_BOSS_59h_Male_Undead_EventTurn02_01	I told Greymane to leave you rotting in prison, Crowley.
VO_GILA_600h_Male_Worgen_EVENT_NEMESIS_INTRO_01	Godfrey you traitor! It's time to pay.
VO_GILA_600h_Male_Worgen_EVENT_NEMESIS_TURN02_01	You were rotten even before you died, Godfrey.

VO_GILA_500h3_Female_Human_EVENT_IVAN_INTRO_01	Ivan! You're coming with me.
VO_GILA_600h_Male_Worgen_EVENT_IVAN_INTRO_01	I've found you! You backstabbing worm.
VO_GILA_400h_Male_Human_EVENT_IVAN_INTRO_01	You were one of us, Ivan!
VO_GILA_900h_Female_Gnome_EVENT_IVAN_INTRO_01	Ivan you're toast. I've seen how this turns out.

VO_RAGNAROS_Male_Elemental_AhuneResponses_01	AHUNE!? UGH, PLEASE GO AWAY!
VO_RAGNAROS_Male_Elemental_AhuneResponses_02	WE ARE NOT... FRIENDS!
VO_RAGNAROS_Male_Elemental_AhuneResponses_05	*GRUMBLE*
VO_AHUNE_Male_Elemental_HSFireFestival_02	YES! ME AND RAGNAROS SHALL CRUSH YOU! TOGETHER!
VO_AHUNE_Male_Elemental_HSFireFestival_04	I'M REALLY ENJOYING YOUR FESTIVAL, BEST FRIEND!
VO_AHUNE_Male_Elemental_HSFireFestival_05	GOOD JOKE FRIEND!
VO_Ragnaros_Male_Elemental_Brawl_01	MOVE ASIDE, FOOL!
VO_Ragnaros_Male_Elemental_Brawl_02	WHO EVEN TOLD YOU ABOUT MY BRAWL!?
VO_Ahune_Male_Elemental_Brawl_18	FREEZE, FOOL!
VO_Ahune_Male_Elemental_Brawl_20	WELL PLAYED BUDDY! WE ALMOST HAD 'EM!
VO_Ragnaros_Male_Elemental_Brawl_05	*SIGH* THIS IS WHY I WORK ALONE...
VO_Ahune_Male_Elemental_Brawl_25	WE DID IT! GOOD JOB, BEST FRIEND!
VO_Ragnaros_Male_Elemental_Brawl_07	NO! I DID IT! NOW LEAVE ME ALONE!

VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_UI_01	Have you got an eye for perfection? Cloning IS an exact science.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_UI_04	Part of your contract says I'm to share you with Luna. What a waste.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_UI_05	Enough fraternizing with her assistants. Help her and return.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_UI_06	Now that you've had practice, here's your real job. Cloning ME.

VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_UI_01	You there! Why are you idling about? We have crops to grow!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_UI_02	A strong start! I've got some gloop to spray when you're ready.

VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_UI_01	New blood? Visit my assistant. She'll get you started.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_UI_02	Excellent. Help me clear out these stubborn minions.

VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_UI_01	Interested in my Necrium experiments? Just visit my recruiter.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_UI_03	I've been working on some experiments with Necrium. Come, let's dance.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_UI_04	Seems Electra is about to explode... again. Why don't you give her some "assistance."
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_UI_05	Dilly dally much longer and I suspect there won't be an Electra to assist.

VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_UI_01	Come one, come all, to the spectacular Boomatorium!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_UI_02	You wanna see the big guns? Look no further!

VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_UI_01	I see you survived Flark's lab. Come. There is REAL work to be done.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_UI_02	Enough, Glow-Tron. It is time for something more… illuminating.

VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Intro_01	Here we go again. I'll ready the minions, sir.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Return_01	There you are! I've kept the minions nice and warm.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Puzzle_01	Watch the fire on this one!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Puzzle_02	It’s your job and all, but does the world really need more of me?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Puzzle_03	Not half bad! Make sure you clone all my devilish charm.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Puzzle_04	You’re doing better than I thought! After that last assistant… <_shudder_>
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Puzzle_06	Almost done! Clone #363 is going to be perfect!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Restart_01	Be careful! I’m delicate.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Restart_02	Oh ho!  Watch the goods!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Restart_03	Whew, thanks. Something didn't feel quite right.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Idle_01	I hope you know what you’re doing.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Idle_02	Let’s think about this. Carefully.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Idle_03	Let's think about this, heheh carefully.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Idle_04	Yehehe yehehmmmm yeheh.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Idle_05	Yehehe hehehheeee
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Idle_06	Ah… Are you SURE you wanna try that?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Idle_07	Listen, buddy, pal…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Idle_08	Why did I sign up for this?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Idle_09	You’re thinking about trying THAT? Oof.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Idle_10	Hope that’ll work…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_Idle_11	Eh, it’s a living. Plus, it’s got GREAT health benefits.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_EmoteResponse_02	You know, it’s nice to have someone to talk to.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_EmoteResponse_03	Science has gotten so impersonal these days.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_EmoteResponse_04	Can you talk and clone at the same time?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_01h_Male_Gnome_EmoteResponse_05	Don’t worry, you don’t have to duplicate what I say. 

VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_Intro_01	Carry the four… twenty-seven? Ugh. Hey, mind if I pick your brain?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_Return_01	Have we met before? Oh right! You were helping me!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_Puzzle_02	None of these numbers seem to add up…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_Puzzle_03	I have been stuck on this problem for HOURS.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_Puzzle_05	Oh, don't forget the order of operations!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_Restart_01	Don't worry! I brought an eraser.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_Restart_02	Back to the square root of one.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_Idle_01	But if you do that… hmmm…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_Idle_02	What if you…. nope… nope… nope… nope.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_Idle_03	Oh what if you…. No…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_Idle_04	I mean there's no way THAT could work… right?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_Idle_05	This just doesn't add up… *Gasp* But does it subtract up?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_Idle_06	That puts it to three… Sorry, am I distracting you?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_Idle_07	Perhaps a paradigm shift is in order…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_Idle_08	Think… We've got to use our heads.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_EmoteResponse_01	I've been surrounded by math my whole life. Literally…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_EmoteResponse_03	You plus me?  Unlikely.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_EmoteResponse_04	Focus on the task at hand, please.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_Complete_01	You're amazing! I'm sure Luna could use your help! She's been so frazzled.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_03h_Female_Human_Whoops_01	Ooh… A miscalculation!

VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Intro_01	There you are! Come. We've work to do.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Return_01	Ah! I calculated an 83% probability you'd return.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Puzzle_01	These were so beautiful… before they broke. Fix them.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Puzzle_02	Symmetry is the key to understanding the cosmos!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Puzzle_03	The possibilities are endless.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Puzzle_04	The stars and planets must align.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Puzzle_05	It is so hard to imitate the real thing.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Puzzle_06	There is so much left to be discovered.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Restart_01	Seems you've fizzled out. From the top.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Restart_02	Just as stars from cosmic dust, we are reborn. *Sigh*  Or given another chance.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Restart_03	The light of the stars will show you the way. This time, hopefully.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Restart_05	Algalon, give us your blessing. We will succeed.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Idle_01	This is what I get for not hiring an archivist.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Idle_03	I miss their twinkling beauty….
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Idle_04	There's a pattern in there, look deep.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Idle_05	So many solutions yet to be explored.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Idle_07	True beauty lies within symmetry.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Idle_08	My beautiful constellations…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Idle_09	The constellar are so magnificent. I hope to meet one one day.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_EmoteResponse_01	Your voice, it reminds me of a supernova. Noisy.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_EmoteResponse_02	Why must Boom always choose the chatty ones.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_EmoteResponse_03	Did you speak this much to Zerek? *Sigh* I do not envy him.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_04h_Female_Draenei_Complete_01	Thank you. *Sigh* I suppose Zerek can have you back.

VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Tutorial_01	Very good. Now, try to make an exact duplicate of my test subject's minions.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Tutorial_03	Nice work! Cloning Gnomes is easy. Mostly.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Tutorial_04	Some minions may be able to attack right away. Be watchful.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Tutorial_05	Sometimes the solution may be hidden. Keep an open mind.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Tutorial_06	Not all your tools are used in every situation. Some may lead you astray.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Complete_01	Bravo! You're a quick learner. Let's see what you can REALLY do.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Complete_03	How wonderful! I'll be sure to put in a good word, or two, with Dr. Boom.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Intro_01	It's time to clone ME.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Return_01	I admire your determination.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Puzzle_01	More complex than Gnomes and stars no doubt.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Puzzle_02	I know, I know. It's hard to duplicate something so close to perfection already.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Puzzle_03	Good artists copy. Great artists copy AND paste.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Restart_01	I expect nothing but perfection.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Restart_02	The solution is there. Look hard.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Restart_03	Everything must be exact.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Restart_04	You cannot fail. We must succeed.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Restart_05	You cannot fail. We must succeed.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Restart_06	Exact. Down to the very last detail.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Idle_03	All your previous work, it pales in comparison.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Idle_04	All that matters, is my perfect clone…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Idle_05	You've got this. I'm sure of it.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Idle_07	 Ah… uh… I know the answer, I'm just curious on how you would do it.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Idle_08	Don't give up, you've come so far…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Idle_09	What should I name my clone? I dare not degrade myself with numbers…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Idle_10	I will become… Zerek Prime!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Idle_11	Immortality is within my grasp! Uh… Pseudo-immortality…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_EmoteResponse_01	Right back at you.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_EmoteResponse_02	Copy that.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Complete_02	How wonderful! I'll be sure to put in a good word, or two, with Dr. Boom.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Stuck_02	Not every path leads to perfection. Try again.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Stuck_03	I can see the gears turning in your head. Give it another shot.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Stuck_04	We can't all be perfect. Yet. I'm still working on that part.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_05h_Male_Ethereal_Stuck_05	Take a moment. Reflect on your thoughts. Start over.

VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Tutorial_02	I need you to clear out EVERY SINGLE MINION from the field! 
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Tutorial_03	Floopulous! Ha ha!  We're on our way to a new strand of tasty Psychmelon.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Tutorial_04	I've supplied plenty of tools, but uh, not all will work.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Tutorial_06	Great goopily-floopily! How are we going to remove those?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Tutorial_07	Some of your minions can attack right away.  Make good use of them.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Complete_01	Excellent. Soon we shall see the fruits of our efforts.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Intro_01	Welcome to MY greenhouse! 
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Return_01	You're back! Ready to work?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Restart_01	No work is without merit. We learn as we live.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Restart_02	Ahhh… A seed planted in our mind. I'm sure it will blossom.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Restart_03	With a careful touch, we'll get there.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Restart_04	Our efforts will germinate. In time.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Restart_05	We can take things slow. Just as grass grows.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Idle_01	I do hope there's a way to remove these minions without force…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Idle_02	If only we had a couple of Bananas…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Idle_03	All the tools are here, but uh… how do we use them?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Idle_05	We have got to displace them all… Hmmm….
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Idle_06	Think of all the mouths we could feed with these crops…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Idle_07	Where does my gloop come from? Well, that's a trade secret!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Idle_09	They say speaking positive words to plants helps them grow.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_EmoteResponse_01	Let's save some of that energy for harvesting! 
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_EmoteResponse_03	Whoa, whoa… Settle down there sprout.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_EmoteResponse_04	Well, gloop you too!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Complete_02	Glooooooptastic! Ha ha!  Dr. Morrigan could use you next.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Puzzle_01	We mustn't waste precious goop! Get rid of this trash for me.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Puzzle_02	These are leftovers from a previous experiment. Make them… go away.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Puzzle_03	None of these minions are vegetables! Clear this rabble!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Stuck_01	We're infested with minions. Hm… This may take some hard work.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Stuck_02	Powerful enemy minions are a great way to clear several of your own.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Stuck_03	Experimentation is at the heart of science. Don't be afraid to try new things.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ooze_Stuck_04	Make use of all your tools. You never know when a new idea might work.

VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Intro_01	I've untangled the hose boss!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Return_01	We're right where you left off!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Puzzle_01	Even if they're our friends, they gotta go! We'll need the whole field.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Puzzle_02	Some of these minions really like to stick around. Freeloaders.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Puzzle_03	Oh! Oh! Maybe we can cause a chain reaction!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Restart_01	Keep at it, think of all the delicious fruit we can grow!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Restart_02	Don't worry, the hose ain't going anywhere.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Restart_03	Wow they're really rooted in there, huh?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Restart_04	A tangled mess. Let's give it another go!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Restart_05	Ah, don't feel too droopy, I've got your back.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Idle_01	All these minions, standing on such PREMIUM soil!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Idle_02	Hohoho!  Psychmelon, Snowplum, Bearsing, Skypeach…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Idle_03	Westfall Apples, Gilnean Pumpkins, Zandalari Zucchini…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Idle_04	Tundraberries, Golden Grapes, oh oh... and Stranglethorn Bananas!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Idle_05	Ah ah… My mouth is watering just at the thought…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Idle_06	We're running out of daylight! Oh wait, we're underground…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Idle_07	Ahhh, these poor saps…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_EmoteResponse_01	Green thumb? I got two of those!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_EmoteResponse_02	You a fruit connoisseur too? Floop's are the BEST.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_EmoteResponse_03	Eh, you're all bark.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_PlaySap_01	Sap is great for those sticky minions.

VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Intro_01	Time to get these batteries charged up.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Return_01	Had to recharge yourself?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Restart_01	We'll need to gather enough souls in a single batch. Try again.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Restart_02	Hmmm, not quite enough souls.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Restart_03	I'll return their souls so we can restart. We need them all at once.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Restart_04	Keep trying! Harvesting souls is hard work but the screams are SO gratifying.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Restart_05	Don't give up! Although, if you do, perhaps we'll use your soul instead…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Idle_01	Sorting these souls might prove difficult…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Idle_02	Don't worry, this is for the greater good. Surely.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Idle_03	So much untapped power just floating about.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Idle_04	If we can filter and process these souls…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Idle_05	Do they even have weight? How strange…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Idle_06	Could we- no no… That'd be far too dangerous.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Idle_07	To think we've only stored these in soulstones for years.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Idle_08	How did you think Boom kept the lights on here?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Idle_09	There is so much knowledge hidden away from us…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_EmoteResponse_01	Soulmates? I don't think so.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_EmoteResponse_02	Certainly you don't intend to TALK these minions into giving up their souls, do you?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_EmoteResponse_03	You spend your life around tormented souls and you start to hear things...
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_PlayHorror_01	Oh the Horror! I think I chipped my hoof.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_PlayWeakness_01	Their bodies may be weak, but their souls remain strong!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_PlayAnima_01	The soul inside is set to auto eject if no "threats" are found.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Complete_01	An impressive sight! Perhaps Morrigan could use your mind…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Puzzle_01	Floop harvests crops, we harvest souls. Remarkably similar.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_PuzzleALT_01	Clear this board of minions, but save the souls for me. I've got... plans.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Puzzle_02	Minions inside of minions, is that double soul value?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_08h_Female_Eredar_Puzzle_03	These ones are resilient. We'll have to work around their abilities.


VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Intro_01	Get to work. We have little time to waste.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Return_01	You've been slacking off. Let's resume.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Restart_01	This won't work. Restart!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Restart_02	We need more power.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Restart_03	These souls are valuable. We can't let any go to waste.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Restart_04	That lively look in their eyes. It would chill my spine. If I had one.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Restart_05	When you do this for a living they all start to look the same.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Idle_01	Efficiency is key. Make the most of what you have.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Idle_02	If we can manage to compress enough into a single vessel…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Idle_03	These are high quality souls, do be careful.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Idle_04	This work is vital.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Idle_05	This work is vital.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Idle_06	You wouldn't believe how many applicants thought we were talking shoes…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Idle_07	Hmmmmm…..
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_EmoteResponse_01	Harvest myself? I'm a banshee, not a soul.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_EmoteResponse_02	I know us Banshees are known for our wails but you can speak normally.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_EmoteResponse_03	Give me one good reason I should not harvest you where you stand.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_PlayDefile_01	Ahhhhhhhahaha, the screaming.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_PlayTicking_01	What a lovely minion. So… efficient.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Complete_01	Perhaps the living are not as bad as I thought… Good work.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Puzzle_01	My work will no doubt be more complex. Will you manage?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Puzzle_02	As you can see, these minions stubbornly cling to their souls. 
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Puzzle_03	I can't stand all the… breathing… DESTROY THEM ALL!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Puzzle_04	Ahhhh, the living. END THEM.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Banshee_Puzzle_05	I have assembled some amazing talent. NOW SWALLOW THEIR SOULS. 

VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Tutorial_01	We'll start you off with some pain tolerance testing. Try and "knock him out."
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Tutorial_04	Some minions can attack right away. Quick and painful.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Tutorial_05	The best scientists are willing to sacrifice.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Tutorial_06	If you're having trouble, experiment! That's what we're here for.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Intro_01	Time to put this Necrium to good use.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Return_01	Good thing this doesn't have a half-life. Let's continue.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Restart_01	Resources that valuable can't go to waste.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Restart_02	Again, please.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Restart_03	I'll reset the experiment. 
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Restart_04	So many things to try!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Restart_05	Again. Do it again!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Restart_06	A good call. Clear the slate.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Idle_01	I'm not rotting any faster.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Idle_02	Necrium is such a tricky element. It can warp the mind.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Idle_03	An interesting approach. Can't say I'd have done the same.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Idle_04	So many applications. Weapons… Poisons… More weapons…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Idle_05	How would this work on someone living?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Idle_06	Working with new elements is always so exciting!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Idle_07	Don't pull any punches. I'm already dead.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_EmoteResponse_01	You're more dead inside than me.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_EmoteResponse_02	Where is some mind-numbing poison when you need it?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_EmoteResponse_03	Is your plan to talk me to death? Is your tongue coated in poison?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Puzzle_01	The side effects don't scare me. I'm already dead.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Puzzle_02	Hands-on research is the most efficient.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Puzzle_04	Ahhh weapons. I like your style.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Lethal_01	Hmmmm… Potent.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Lethal_02	Pain. That's something I haven't felt in a while.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Lethal_03	I'm glad I'm not alive for this.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Lethal_04	Tricky, but well done.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_14h_Female_Undead_Lethal_05	AHH! I just got an idea.

VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Intro_01	Become a poison tester today! Just sign right here…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Return_01	Become a poison test- Ah, you. You've already signed.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Puzzle_01	Wait I am the recipient? Let me check my contract...
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Puzzle_02	I've seen this testing before. It can't be that bad… right?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Puzzle_03	Oh I shouldn't have signed in ink…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Restart_01	Not quite potent enough, but do not give up!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Restart_02	A stronger brew means a bigger paycheck for us. Right?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Restart_03	Stings a bit, but I am sure it could be stronger!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Restart_04	I'm sure there's correction fluid somewhere…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Restart_05	I've got a stack of these contracts if you want to start fresh.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Restart_06	At least I will build up a tolerance to this.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Idle_01	Page 12: Participant forfeits all rights to legal recourse…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Idle_02	In event of accident recipient must donate their assets to Dr.Boom…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Idle_03	Poisonee must survive at least 10 doses to receive payment…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Idle_04	Page 36: Under no circumstance may trade secrets be shared. Shocker.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Idle_06	Side effects may include stomach pain, nausea... hair loss…?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Idle_08	This contract may be modified at any point for any reason? Oh come on!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Idle_09	*Sigh*  Perhaps I should have read my contract in full…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Idle_10	Read the fine print? This is ALL fine print!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Idle_11	This is what I've been making people sign up for? Whew…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_EmoteResponse_01	I'm always open to swap if you are! It is quite fun! I promise!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_EmoteResponse_02	While I would love to help you out I think I will hold my tongue…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_EmoteResponse_03	Oh what have I gotten us into…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_EmoteResponse_04	I do not think you will be able to talk your way out of this one.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Complete_01	I think… that will do… I'm going to go lie down.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Lethal_01	Doh... Stings!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Lethal_02	Dooohoohoo! That will bruise.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Lethal_03	Alright alright! I get it!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Lethal_04	Whoawhoawhoa. Hold it there. Close enough.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Lethal_05	Whoawhoawhoa.  Close enough.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Lethal_06	Yeeeowwww! Yep… yep... \nthat works.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_10h_Male_NightElf_Lethal_08	Gyeooo, check that one\n off the list…


VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Intro_01	Are you here to see Electra? Isn't she the best?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Return_01	Were you recharging too?  Ah, let's get back to it!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Puzzle_01	If you help me show her how tough I am, I'll introduce you. Deal?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Puzzle_03	Electra is sooooo strong. If I can't take this, I'll never catch up!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Puzzle_05	I love the smell of fresh rain in the morning.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Restart_01	*Sigh*  I'll need to be able to handle more to impress Electra!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Restart_02	I don't mean to burst your bubble but I think we're stuck.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Restart_03	Let's try again! I'm sure we can impress her with this!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Restart_04	Don't worry, I'm sure I can be just like her!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Restart_05	Ohhh, we can do better!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Restart_06	C'mon, c'mon, let's try again!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Restart_07	Recharge? I'm in!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Restart_08	I'm tougher than I look! Bring it on!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Idle_01	La la la la.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Idle_02	Hm hm hm hm hum hm hm!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Idle_03	The thunderstorms in Netherstorm are so pretty!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Idle_04	I'll catch up to her, I'm sure of it!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Idle_05	Hmmm… Water IS a great conductor of electricity…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Idle_06	Do you think you'll make a… shocking discovery for her? Hehe.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Idle_07	Heeheehee, WHAT'RE you waiting for?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Idle_08	If only you had a little more mana… hmmm…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Idle_09	Electra says I'm "impact resistant". I think that's a good thing.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_EmoteResponse_01	I'd wave back if I could!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_EmoteResponse_02	Awww, thanks! Your kindness will tide me over.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_EmoteResponse_03	Gross. Now I've got your spittle in me.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_PlayHealingRain_01	How is Healing RAIN going to- oooooohhhhh….
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Complete_01	You did it! Let me introduce you to Electra. She's uh… a bit of a tempest right now.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Lethal_01	Hahahah! That tickles!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Lethal_02	Splishy splashy splishy splashy~
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Lethal_04	Pththtbt.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Lethal_05	Uhhuhhuh.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_12h_Female_WaterSpirit_Lethal_06	It's like a whirlpool in my stomach.

VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Intro_01	This power… is overwhelming!!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Return_01	Where have you been!? I need you!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Restart_01	Lightning CAN strike twice. Or thrice. Don't hold back. 
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Restart_02	Shocking. SHOCKING!  Ha ha!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Restart_03	Are you a HurriCAN? Or a HurriCAN'T!? 
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Restart_04	I must store this kinetic energy.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Restart_05	This puzzle's a real twister. TWISTER!  Whoo!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Restart_06	That was striking. STRIKING!  Oh ho!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Idle_01	I have become a vessel for RAW POWER!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Idle_02	The storms will bend to my will! 
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Idle_03	Has science gone too far?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Idle_04	Did someone say… THUNDERFURY!? No? Oh I - I thought someone did.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Idle_05	*Gasp* Did someone say… THUNDERFURY!? No? Oh I - I thought someone did.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Idle_06	Stumped? I'm sure inspiration will… STRIKE! Hahaaaa!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Idle_07	Take your time. This will all blow over. BLOW OVER? Ha ha ha ha!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Idle_08	If I played a mill deck… It would be… A WIND MILL! Ah ha! Gotta love it.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_EmoteResponse_01	Aw HAIL no!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_EmoteResponse_02	It's not my heat. It's my humidity!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_EmoteResponse_03	Why so cirrus? HA! Get it? Get it!?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_PlayVolcano_01	No no NO! Weather falls down, it doesn't shoot up!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Complete_01	Ahhhh… whew… thank you. I'm feeling a little better now.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Puzzle_01	I've absorbed too much of the Netherstorm, I'm overwhelmed!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Puzzle_02	I am surging with power… act quickly!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Puzzle_03	Can you neutralize… THIS!?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Puzzle_04	I've overloaded the whole lab! Hehahaha! Somebody stop me!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Puzzle_06	My rain of terror continues. RAIN! Get it? Ahhhh!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_13h_Female_Elemental_Puzzle_07	Cloudy with a chance of… ME!  Ah ha!

VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Intro_01	Are you the new test subject? I will light the fuse!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Return_01	You came back for more!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_Night Elf_Puzzle_01	Ohooho! This is going be such fun!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_Night Elf_Puzzle_03	I always enjoy patching myself up after a long day at work!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Restart_01	If at first you do not succeed…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Restart_03	Would it hurt to try again?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Restart_04	If it went boom in your face right now… yeah… let us restart.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Restart_05	Let us give it another go.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Restart_06	That did not work?  Hmmm…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Restart_07	All it takes is a spark.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Idle_01	What happens if I light this fuse…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Idle_02	Could we strap some fireworks to that minion?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Idle_03	What if I double the gunpowder…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Idle_04	How does Flark add all those colors?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Idle_05	Think you could… outrun it?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Idle_06	This is a tough one… Glad I am not taking the hit!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_EmoteResponse_01	Looks like you have got an explosive personality yourself! Hmmhmmhmmhmm
VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_EmoteResponse_02	I am having a blast. You?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Puzzle_03	I always enjoy patching myself up after a long day at work!

VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Complete_01	Hey you did it! Next in line, ME.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Intro_01	I am the master of booms, the BOOMMASTER!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Return_01	You return! After your uhh... "tactical retreat."
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_PuzzleA_01	Breena's work pales in comparison to the raw destructive POWER I possess!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_PuzzleB_01	My uhhh… fireworks that is. I'm not making bombs or anything. Promise.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Puzzle_02	How will you survive? I'm on the edge of my seat!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Idle_01	Hm… Uh huh…  Hmmmmmmmm…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Idle_02	Nyeh. I just wanna blow stuff up.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Idle_03	Pffft… You blow up THREE interns and suddenly there's safety regulations.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Idle_04	Pffft… You blow up three lousy interns and suddenly there's safety regulations.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Idle_05	Can I light the fuse yet? No? …How about now?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Idle_06	How on Azeroth are you going to survive this? Oh wait we're on Outland…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Idle_07	Have you tried uh… uh… gaining  armor? I'm out of ideas.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Idle_08	Where's the fuse that's normally going off by now? I miss it.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Idle_09	Choices choices…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_EmoteResponse_01	You want a piece of me? You're about to be in pieces yourself!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_EmoteResponse_02	Whoo!  And they say I'VE got a short fuse…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_EmoteResponse_03	Yeesh!  And they say I'VE got a short fuse…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_PlayDrywhisker_01	Ohh, yup. Yeah. That's why you were giving me minions. I get it.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Complete_02	Wow!  What a spectacular show! The way you exploded… Mwah! Magnificent.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Tutorial_01	We're testing out some fireworks in here. On your face. Try and survive, yeah?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Tutorial_02	Don't worry we'll try not to fire them off before you're ready.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Tutorial_04	You never know when some of these minions might come in handy.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Tutorial_06	It'd be no fun if you were at full health. We need to keep things exciting!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Stuck_01	Eh… What can you do? Round 2.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Stuck_02	If you're not ready, just give us a signal. You got all the time in the world.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Stuck_03	Gotta make sure you can take the hit. Can't lose another intern…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Stuck_04	I ain't ready to see these sparks fly. Heh.  Not yet.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Restart_01	I'll just fire these off into the air and grab some new ones.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Restart_02	Duds?! Bah! I'll get more out of storage.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Restart_03	Yeah I agree. Needed more gunpowder anyways.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Restart_04	I can't wait for the boom! Not my boss. The fireworks.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Restart_05	This is one loooooooong fuse.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_16h_Male_Goblin_Restart_06	The anticipation!

VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_Restart_02	I see a ray of hope. You will succeed.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_Restart_03	There is no use looming on it.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_Restart_04	Hold still. You have tripped a breaker. 
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_Restart_06	Begin again!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_Idle_01	Hmmm… The light can be harnessed in so many ways.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_Idle_02	Dr. Boom will put this laser to good use. I am sure.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_Idle_03	If only we could glean some insight…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_Idle_05	There are many ways to mitigate or absorb damage. 
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_Idle_06	The light bends to my will… and I will it to destroy!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_Idle_07	Do not look directly into the laser.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_Idle_09	These lasers also drive the cats here crazy.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_EmoteResponse_01	I don't take this lightly.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_EmoteResponse_02	*Sigh* I tried solar energy but we don't get much sunlight in the Netherstorm…
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_PlayMalGanis_01	More eternal than the light? I think not.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_Complete_01	You have a bright future before you.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_Puzzle_01	You will now test my latest laser. It is truly brilliant.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_Puzzle_02	That is acceptable. Let us amp things up.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_Puzzle_03	De-light-ful. It is all becoming crystal clear.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_18h_Male_Golem_Puzzle_04	Mmm… You exude a radiant aura after being hit. 

VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_UI_Welcome_01	Wanted: Highly energetic, morally flexible researchers to engage in air-quote “Science.” You in or what!?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_UI_Intro_01	This is BOOM LABS! We do good work for bad ends. Why don’t you tour the facility?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_UI_Intro_02	This is BOOM LABS! Prove your competence with my people and we’ll talk.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_UI_Wing1_Complete_01	Terrific! I don’t have to fire you the way I fired the other applicants. From a cannon.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_UI_Wing2_Complete_01	You’re smart! Could we dissect your brain? Not now of course! Hehahahaha, we’ll work with your schedule.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_UI_Wing3_Complete_01	Well done! I hope you’re documenting all of your findings for future shredding.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_UI_Wing4_Complete_01	INCREDIBLE! I am granting you PRIORITY ONE access to the BOOMSDAY PROJECT!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_UI_Boom_Coin1_Start_01	Welcome, friend, to the mind of BOOM! Don’t get lost. It’s twisted.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_UI_Boom_Coin2_Start_01	The best part of an intricate master plan is making it up as you go along.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_UI_Boom_Coin3_Start_01	The Boomsday Project is nearly complete. Soon, we’ll know what we’re building!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_UI_Boom_Coin4_Start_01	Time is running out! It’s BOOOMSDAY!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Idle_01	Ah yeah, sure, take your time. This is a delicate operation. 
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Idle_02	Concentrate. CONCENTRATE! …am I distracting you?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Idle_03	Ohhh… did I stump ya?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Idle_04	Work the problem. If that fails, I resort to bribery.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Idle_05	It's good to plan ahead. Me? I plan behind. Results are guaranteed.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Idle_06	Remember: Every solution has a problem.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Failure_01	It’s okay. Science isn’t an exact science.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Failure_02	No problem. It's not rocket science. OR IS IT?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Failure_04	Nobody's perfect. Except me. It's my worst flaw.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Failure_05	Take heart! Science is built on mistakes, that's why I'm good at it.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Failure_06	Huh. Yeah. I guess failure IS an option.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_One_Liner_18	Your superior weapons are no match for my crude intellect! No wait – the other thing!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_One_Liner_11	Science is the answer! What was the question again?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_One_Liner_02	Stumped on some puzzles? Have some brain food! It’s made with real brain.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_One_Liner_04	Science is more than blowing things up. It’s careful observation. Of things blowing up.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Mirror_01	Mirror, mirror, that I grab, who's the smartest in my lab?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Mirror_02	You're so lucky you get to gaze upon the TRUE perfection that is I.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Mirror_03	How can you copy me if I don't even know what I'm doing? Think about it.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Mirror_04	Oh no! You've defeated- just kidding. I knew you'd try that. Doesn't work. NEXT!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Lethal_01	Trying to take me down? You've got guts! How do I extract them from you?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Lethal_02	Boom bots… Kaboom bots… KADOOM BOTS!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Survival_01	I've turned the knob up TO ELEVEN! ….OUT OF FIVE!!!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Survival_02	The last time I fired this baby I lost half my lab leads. Worth it.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Clear_02	This puppy is almost as unstable as me. Almost.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Trigger_Thermaplug_01	Leper gnomes! Yuheeeee, they're so small and green!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_Trigger_Mechathun_01	We painstakingly reconstructed the remains of an Old God. For some reason.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_UI_Boom_Coin1_End_01	All part of my master plan! I think. It’s a work in progress.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_UI_Boom_Coin2_End_01	I didn’t get my doctorate in explosions just to watch everything I’ve built blow to pieces!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_UI_Boom_Coin3_End_01	No no NO! You're not supposed to outsmart ME! That's MY job!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_UI_Boom_Coin4_Victory_01	All I wanted was to sew widespread chaos as a prelude to megalomaniacal global domination… WAS THAT SO WRONG!?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_UI_Boom_Coin4_Victory_02	No! My master plan is ruined! Who would've thought relying on eight unstable evil supergeniuses could've backfired!? 
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_One_Liner_12	I assure you my conscience is clean. It's never been used.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_One_Liner_17	Do you know who I am!? I put the MEGA in Megalomaniac!! 
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_One_Liner_09	Do you know how I got these scars…?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_One_Liner_10	…No, seriously, I’m asking. My memories of the last decade are pretty patchy.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_One_Liner_19	I ask you: Why only collide particles? We could collide so many things.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_One_Liner_03	CHAOS! It’s not just a theory anymore. I’ve proven it! 
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_One_Liner_15	The way I programmed this mech suit to walk was staggering. Yenha?
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_One_Liner_13	We tried switching the labs from using pounds to using kilograms. Hoo! Mass confusion!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_One_Liner_06	The Ray of Roasting! A weapon of devastating power. Super handy at a picnic.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_One_Liner_14	I am also a master forger. And I have the paperwork to back it up!
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_One_Liner_01	You've got quite the brain on you. Could you report to the Metrics Lab for jar-sizing? No reason.
VO_BOTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Goblin_One_Liner_08	According to the Boom uncertainty principle, cards in your deck exist in a superposition until drawn.

VO_DALA_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_TUT_04_Hero_Select_01	We have recruited an elite band of disenfranchised miscreants. Each have their own strengths.
VO_DALA_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_TUT_05_Hero_Power_Select_01	As we plunder the riches of Dalaran, we will gain ever greater kleptomaniacal skills.

VO_DALA_DrBoom_Male_Goblin_STORY_Sewers_Turn2_01_01	So I might’ve accidentally sliced into a toxic sewer gas line…
VO_DALA_DrBoom_Male_Goblin_STORY_Sewers_Turn2_02_01	You’ll be fine as long as you don’t move. Or breathe.

VO_DALA_DrBoom_Male_Goblin_STORY_Sewers_Boss_Flark_02	I should’ve suspected Flark’s betrayal. When he stormed from the lab. Yelling, "I’ll get you!"
VO_DALA_DrBoom_Male_Goblin_STORY_Sewers_Boss_Flark_03	Hurry! Blow this place up before Flark… blows this place up!

VO_DALA_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_STORY_MageTower_Boss_Khadgar_01	Khadgar leads the Kirin Tor. Running him from town will be a supreme triumph.

VO_DALA_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_STORY_MageTower_Boss_Khadgar_03	Khadgar is powerful but easily distracted. Try dangling some keys in front of him. 
VO_DALA_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_STORY_MageTower_Boss_Khadgar_04	The archmage is smart. Be smarter. The archmage is skilled. So… cheat.
VO_DALA_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_STORY_MageTower_Boss_Kalec_01	Kalec is a blue dragon in human form. Don’t give him a chance to spread his wings.
VO_DALA_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_STORY_MageTower_Boss_Kalec_02	Kalec is the very incarnation of magic. Move quickly, before he saws someone in half.
VO_DALA_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_STORY_MageTower_Boss_Kalec_03	Beware! Kalec is secretly a blue dragon. It’s not a big secret. It’s on his ID.
VO_DALA_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_STORY_MageTower_Boss_Kalec_04	Kalec will summon dragons to utterly destroy you! Do not worry. I will be fine.
VO_DALA_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_STORY_MageTower_Boss_ArchivistOshi_01	Ah, Dalaran’s archivist. Keeping alive the memories of the dead.

VO_DALA_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_STORY_MageTower_Boss_Xurios_01	Xur’ios! The craftiest of ethereals. Your magic will be unstable around him.
VO_DALA_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_STORY_MageTower_Boss_Akazamzarak_01	This citadel is home to the greatest mages of Azeroth! As well as Akazamzarak.
VO_DALA_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_STORY_MageTower_Boss_TipsiWobblerune_01	Tipsi is opening up portals willy-nilly. That is of course the most dangerous of nillys.

VO_DALA_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_STORY_MageTower_Treasure_MasterPlan_01	The different between a “Plan” and a “Master Plan” is the menace of the laughter.
VO_DALA_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_STORY_MageTower_Victory_01_01	The Kirin Tor is on the run. Without their leaders, we control the City! Ha-haha-Muwahahaha!

VO_DALA_Chu_Male_Pandaren_Start_03	You are in my way.

VO_DALA_BOSS_04h_Female_Undead_HeroPower_01	Let's just push a couple buttons and...
VO_DALA_BOSS_04h_Female_Undead_HeroPower_02	You never know what's gonna come out of there.
VO_DALA_BOSS_04h_Female_Undead_HeroPower_03	These wormholes seem to aggravate the minions.
VO_DALA_BOSS_04h_Female_Undead_HeroPower_04	WORMHOLE COMBAT!
VO_DALA_BOSS_04h_Female_Undead_HeroPowerWin_01	Ahhh, just as I predicted. Only one casualty.
VO_DALA_BOSS_04h_Female_Undead_HeroPowerWin_02	Their velocity coming out of these portals seems dangerous.
VO_DALA_BOSS_04h_Female_Undead_HeroPowerLose_01	A slight miscalculation.
VO_DALA_BOSS_04h_Female_Undead_HeroPowerLose_02	Ooof. Sorry friend.
VO_DALA_BOSS_04h_Female_Undead_HeroPowerBoth_01	It's like nothing ever happened.

VO_DALA_BOSS_04h_Female_Undead_HeroPowerBossOnly_01	Ooh, didn't bring enough friends?
VO_DALA_BOSS_04h_Female_Undead_HeroPowerPlayerOnly_01	Seems I'm all out of test subjects...

VO_DALA_BOSS_05h_Male_Gnome_PlayerBigSpell_01	Ooh ho ho! Be careful what you cast!
VO_DALA_BOSS_05h_Male_Gnome_PlayerBigSpell_03	Wow! Hope I can copy that one!

VO_DALA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Intro_01	I am the Horde's warchief. And as such, I AM the Horde.
VO_DALA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Intro_03	Lok-narash! I will show no mercy!

VO_DALA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_BossWarriorSpell_01	I'll show you the power of a true warchief!
VO_DALA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_PlayerDKCardHeroic_01	You're not the only one with a dark power inside!
VO_DALA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Idle_02	Hmmm...
VO_DALA_BOSS_06h_Male_Goblin_Idle_03	Hmmm... I wonder...

VO_DALA_BOSS_06dk_Male_Goblin_Idle_01	Hmmm... I wonder...
VO_DALA_BOSS_06dk_Male_Goblin_Idle_02	What now...
VO_DALA_BOSS_06dk_Male_Goblin_Idle_03	Time passes...
VO_DALA_BOSS_06dk_Male_Goblin_PlayerScourgelord_01	Oh hey - I was just uh, keeping your seat warm!
VO_DALA_BOSS_06dk_Male_Goblin_PlayerWhirlwind_01	A mere imitation. You don't compare to the real thing.
VO_DALA_BOSS_06dk_Male_Goblin_BossGorehowl_01	Gorehowl will split you in half.
VO_DALA_BOSS_06dk_Male_Goblin_BossCharge_01	Go. Show them the power of the Horde!
VO_DALA_BOSS_06dk_Male_Goblin_Attack_03	Kneel before me!

VO_DALA_BOSS_07h_Male_BloodElf_Idle_01	These griffins keep nipping at their leashes...
VO_DALA_BOSS_07h_Male_BloodElf_Idle_02	Did I remember to feed them...?
VO_DALA_BOSS_07h_Male_BloodElf_Idle_03	I hope this city doesn't move again, all my flight paths...
VO_DALA_BOSS_07h_Male_BloodElf_PlayerUnleashtheBeast_01	You would dare use my own wyvern against me?!
VO_DALA_BOSS_07h_Male_BloodElf_PlayerLeokk_01	Bad Leokk, bad!
VO_DALA_BOSS_07h_Male_BloodElf_PlayerFlightMaster_01	This isn't your flight point, get out of here!
VO_DALA_BOSS_07h_Male_BloodElf_BossBeastBig_01	This one's not for riding!

VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_Intro_01	You're scaring away my customers!
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_IntroGeorge_01	Revenge is a dish best served cold. Like my apples!
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_IntroRakanishu_01	A fire?! Put it out!
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_IntroSqueamlish_01	Oh you adorable little Druid.
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_IntroOlBarkeye_01	Why are you raising your leg?
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_EmoteResponse_01	Oh shush sweety.
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_DefeatPlayer_02	Fruit always rises to the top!
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_HeroPower_01	An apple a day!
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_HeroPower_02	Try turning this into a pie!
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_HeroPower_03	Hya!
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_HeroPower_04	I think I pulled a root.
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_HeroPower_05	They're like nature's toothbrush!
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_Idle_01	My bark could use a rub.
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_Idle_02	These old limbs don't move like they used to.
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_Idle_03	<_Light Snoring_>
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_Idle_04	<_Light Snoring_>
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_Idle_05	Are we still fighting?
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_PlayerDruidSpell_01	Aren't you Druid folks supposed to like trees?
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_PlayerFireMageSpell_01	It burns!
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_PlayerTreant_01	Oh, look at the young ones.
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_PlayerTreant_02	I remember when I was a sapling. It feels like just yesterday...
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_BossWitchwoodApple_01	Got these straight from Gilneas.
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_BossTreeSpeaker_01	They grow up so fast!
VO_DALA_BOSS_08h_Female_Treant_BossTreant_01	Ho ho! They just want to play with you.

VO_DALA_BOSS_09h_Female_Draenei_Intro_01	Intruders? Here? That's a first.

VO_DALA_BOSS_09h_Female_Draenei_IntroTekahn_01	Oh, I've read about you. You're awful.
VO_DALA_BOSS_09h_Female_Draenei_EmoteResponse_01	I've heard that one before.
VO_DALA_BOSS_09h_Female_Draenei_DefeatPlayer_02	This seems... familiar.
VO_DALA_BOSS_09h_Female_Draenei_HeroPower_01	History repeats itself.
VO_DALA_BOSS_09h_Female_Draenei_HeroPower_02	Ah, yes. And so it goes.
VO_DALA_BOSS_09h_Female_Draenei_HeroPower_03	The cycle continues.
VO_DALA_BOSS_09h_Female_Draenei_HeroPower_04	Have you already forgotten?
VO_DALA_BOSS_09h_Female_Draenei_HeroPowerBig_01	I've read tales of this one.
VO_DALA_BOSS_09h_Female_Draenei_HeroPowerBig_02	So quick we are to forget.
VO_DALA_BOSS_09h_Female_Draenei_Idle_01	I could have sworn I've read about this before...
VO_DALA_BOSS_09h_Female_Draenei_Idle_02	Why does this all seem so familiar...
VO_DALA_BOSS_09h_Female_Draenei_Idle_03	Chronicles of evil, Vol 3? No...
VO_DALA_BOSS_09h_Female_Draenei_PlayerBorrowedTime_01	Playing with time is dangerous. Be careful.
VO_DALA_BOSS_09h_Female_Draenei_PlayerTimeWarp_01	Perhaps time is not so predictable.
VO_DALA_BOSS_09h_Female_Draenei_PlayerKelthuzad_01	A shame he was tainted by the dark.
VO_DALA_BOSS_09h_Female_Draenei_BossBigMinion_01	History will remember the tales of this one.
VO_DALA_BOSS_09h_Female_Draenei_Death_02	Not... again...

VO_DALA_BOSS_11h_Male_Kobold_Idle_02	Why nobody else dressed as pirate?

VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_Intro_01	Welcome. Here to peruse my steamy collection?
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_IntroChu_01	Ahh, a regular makes his return.
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_EmoteResponse_01	You could learn a thing or two about conversation from these books.
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_Death_01	Fin...
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_DefeatPlayer_01	Alas, the end to your tale is bittersweet.
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_HeroPower_01	Ahhh, I love a happy ending.
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_HeroPower_02	It brings a tear to my eye.
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_HeroPower_03	I dare not spoil the ending to this couple's journey.
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_HeroPower_04	And off... into the sunset...
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_HeroPowerOne_01	A tale of unrequited love...
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_HeroPowerOne_02	All alone in this world... how sad...
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_HeroPowerOne_03	But will they ever find love? Buy the next volume to find out!
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_PlayerBabblingBook_01	Your books talk to you? I'm glad mine don't.
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_PlayerCabalistTome_01	A book of spells? How dull.
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_PlayerBookOfSpectres_01	Oh no no, I don't do horror well.
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_BossKoboldLibrarian_01	This little one makes my heart melt...
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_BossWarlockFire_01	Ah, the cleansing fire of love.
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_PlayerBookWyrm_01	See? Even Dragons love to read my books!
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_Idle_01	Well if you're not here to mug me, I suppose I'll give you a sample.
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_Idle_02	As Nahhi glided up, the grizzled warrior gave her a hard stare. "I suppose you're here to collect the reward for killing those murlocs?"
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_Idle_03	Her eyes wandered down to the glowing broadsword at his side. "That depends on what the reward is, Marcus."
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_Idle_04	She twirled her hair playfully, pretending not to notice how he shifted uncomfortably in her presence. "I may not want it."
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_Idle_05	Marcus stepped toward her, bristling with a mixture of fear and anger. "The reward is non negotiable!"
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_Idle_09	That's just a teaser. You'll have to read the rest for yourself!
VO_DALA_BOSS_12h_Male_Undead_Death_01	Fin...

VO_DALA_BOSS_13h_Male_Worgen_Intro_01	I've the sharpest blades in Dalaran. Care for a hands-on demo?
VO_DALA_BOSS_13h_Male_Worgen_EmoteResponse_01	Your tongue is sharp. Your wit is dull.
VO_DALA_BOSS_13h_Male_Worgen_DefeatPlayer_01	What a pity. I've cut you down.
VO_DALA_BOSS_13h_Male_Worgen_HeroPower_02	So nice-- when sliced and diced.
VO_DALA_BOSS_13h_Male_Worgen_HeroPower_03	Where's my whetstone? I'll put it to good use.
VO_DALA_BOSS_13h_Male_Worgen_HeroPower_04	A sharp blade. A sharp mind.
VO_DALA_BOSS_13h_Male_Worgen_HeroPower_05	Sharp is the blade, that cuts thrice.
VO_DALA_BOSS_13h_Male_Worgen_HeroPower_06	Ah, my fine opponent. Shred 'em!
VO_DALA_BOSS_13h_Male_Worgen_HeroPowerFriendly_01	It's too sharp! TOO SHARP?!
VO_DALA_BOSS_13h_Male_Worgen_HeroPowerFriendly_02	I've swung a bit too wildly! Or have I...?
VO_DALA_BOSS_13h_Male_Worgen_Idle_01	Wonder if I could pick my teeth with... OW!
VO_DALA_BOSS_13h_Male_Worgen_Idle_02	My poor insurance rates... They better not go up after this.
VO_DALA_BOSS_13h_Male_Worgen_Idle_05	<_Snorting_>

VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_Intro_01	If you're here for schemin' and fightin', find another tavern!
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_IntroOlBarkeye_01	No pets allowed!
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_IntroGeorge_01	We don't serve that here. Get out.
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_IntroChu_01	We're not lookin' for a new bouncer!
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_EmoteResponse_01	Tavern's a bit loud to be running your mouth.
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_DefeatPlayer_01	No one skips out on their tab.
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_HeroPower_01	We've got a new order!
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_HeroPower_02	Order up!
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_HeroPower_03	Need some service out here!
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_HeroPower_04	Our customers needs some "attention"!
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_PlayerBrawl_01	Well, maybe I should hire another bouncer...
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_PlayerBrawl_02	I knew you'd be startin' a big fight in here!
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_PlayerFriendlyBartender_01	Another bartender? How'd you get roped into this?
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_PlayerBarista_01	We don't even serve coffee here. Get out!
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_PlayerInnkeeper_01	Get back to your own inn!
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_PlayerBelligerentGnome_01	This one's a feisty one! Uhh... Is he gonna be ok?
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_BossBrawl_01	Clear on out the back!
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_BossBrawl_02	Just another night in the tavern...
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_BossMinions_01	Aha! One of my favorite customers.
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_BossMinions_02	It's a busy night, but there's always room in here!
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_BossMinions_03	Come right in... but please don't join the fight.
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_BossMinions_04	Regulars starting to filter in - leave 'em alone!
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_Idle_01	They better tip well...
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_Idle_02	I'm glad I'm not working the closing shift tonight.
VO_DALA_BOSS_14h_Female_KulTiran_Idle_03	Customers keep getting ruder and ruder.

VO_DALA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Intro_01	Moon priestess power!
VO_DALA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_IntroKriziki_01	You would twist healing magic in your favor? Pah.
VO_DALA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_EmoteResponse_01	I've heard that before. Somewhere... I think?
VO_DALA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_DefeatPlayer_01	In the name of Elune, I have punished you!
VO_DALA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_HeroPowerTrigger_01	Elune healing escalation!
VO_DALA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_HeroPowerTrigger_02	Bask in the glow of Elune!
VO_DALA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_HeroPowerTrigger_03	Listen up you bad guy, you're a bad guy!
VO_DALA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_HeroPowerTrigger_04	Believe and thrive!
VO_DALA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_HeroPowerTrigger_05	The light of the moon shines on you! And me!
VO_DALA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_HeroPowerTrigger_06	Feel the moon!
VO_DALA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Idle_01	The moon shines brightly...
VO_DALA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Idle_02	Dalaran seems lacking in competent guardians if I'm out here.
VO_DALA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_Idle_03	I miss my frostsaber.
VO_DALA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_PlayerHeal_01	Even villains heal their wounded, then. Hmm.
VO_DALA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_PlayerIllidan_01	The Betrayer walks Dalaran? I AM prepared!
VO_DALA_BOSS_15h_Female_NightElf_PlayerDemon_01	Demons are invading! It's worse than I thought.

VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_Intro_01	Interested in trying something new?
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_IntroGeorge_01	That's not something I can brew up.
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_EmoteResponse_01	Excuse me? Did you mix up your words?
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_Death_02	Bad mix...
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_DefeatPlayer_01	Hmm... I guess that one isn't good for living creatures.
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_HeroPower_01	OK OK, I'll take this and you take that!
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_HeroPower_02	Alchemy is perfectly safe. Most of the time.
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_HeroPower_03	One for you, one for me!
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_HeroPower_04	It's an equal exchange! One for one.
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_HeroPowerSwapBack_01	That won't do. On second thought, let's swap back.
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_Idle_01	I'm not sure if I have any Witchwood root around here...
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_Idle_03	Did I accidentally put you to sleep?
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_Idle_04	This should be safe. Probably.
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_Idle_06	Please... don't drink anything I wouldn't.
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_BossMojomasterZihi_01	I like working with limits. You learn a lot!
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_BossDerrangedDoctor_01	The Doc makes potions with some real bite.
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_BossPotionVendor_01	Hey! Have you met my apprentice? She's going to do great things!
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_PlayerMistressOfMixtures_01	It's not all about potions. Balms, ointments, they're all useful!
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_PlayerCrazedChemist_01	Whoa, should you be mixing those things in here?
VO_DALA_BOSS_16h_Female_Human_PlayerTreasurePotion_02	You're playing with some dangerous ingredients there.

VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_Intro_01	Nature, grant me strength!
VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_IntroSqueamlish_01	This one has followed a... strange path.
VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_IntroGeorge_01	That is the one path I dare not travel.
VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_EmoteResponse_01	So many words, and those are what you choose? 
VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_DefeatPlayer_01	You chose poorly!
VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_HeroPowerTrigger_01	I have chosen both paths.
VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_HeroPowerTrigger_02	I travel all roads before me.
VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_HeroPowerTrigger_03	Why not... both?
VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_HeroPowerTrigger_04	Nature guides my path.
VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_Idle_01	Life is curious. I am not.
VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_Idle_02	Is the Earthmother listening?
VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_Idle_03	I would choose not to wait for you, if I could.
VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_PlayerTreants_01	You would turn nature against me?!
VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_PlayerChooseOne_01	You make choices. I don't.
VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_PlayerFandralStaghelm_01	Ah, you do things the same as I.
VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_PlayerKeeperStellaris_01	 A different way to walk the same paths.
VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_BossNourish_01	Nature can provide all things, if you let it.
VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_BossDruidOfThe_01	Others have chosen my path.
VO_DALA_BOSS_17h_Female_Tauren_BossWardruidLoti_01	My goodness, this one offers... many paths.

VO_DALA_BOSS_18h_Female_Draenei_Intro_01	The elements can be harnessed in many ways. I choose the mighty totem.
VO_DALA_BOSS_18h_Female_Draenei_IntroOlBarkeye_01	Do not gnaw on my totems!
VO_DALA_BOSS_18h_Female_Draenei_IntroVessina_01	You taint the elements, Sethrak.
VO_DALA_BOSS_18h_Female_Draenei_EmoteResponse_01	You cannot intimidate me.
VO_DALA_BOSS_18h_Female_Draenei_DefeatPlayer_01	So this is how you find peace.
VO_DALA_BOSS_18h_Female_Draenei_HeroPower_01	Where did I leave that totem...?
VO_DALA_BOSS_18h_Female_Draenei_HeroPower_02	Elements, guide me.
VO_DALA_BOSS_18h_Female_Draenei_HeroPower_04	Which one did I want again?
VO_DALA_BOSS_18h_Female_Draenei_Idle_01	Give me a second to whittle a new one.
VO_DALA_BOSS_18h_Female_Draenei_Idle_02	You know painting these up is so time consuming.
VO_DALA_BOSS_18h_Female_Draenei_Idle_03	You ever tripped over a totem? Horribly embarrassing...
VO_DALA_BOSS_18h_Female_Draenei_BossWindshearStormcaller_01	Small things grow into greatness!
VO_DALA_BOSS_18h_Female_Draenei_BossTotemicMight_01	Our strength cannot be seen!
VO_DALA_BOSS_18h_Female_Draenei_PlayerTotemCrusher_01	What a monstrous beast.
VO_DALA_BOSS_18h_Female_Draenei_PlayerPrimalTalisman_01	How original.

VO_DALA_BOSS_19h_Female_Gnome_Intro_01	Careful, I'm a sharp one!
VO_DALA_BOSS_19h_Female_Gnome_IntroChu_01	Really? You can't just walk around me, huh?
VO_DALA_BOSS_19h_Female_Gnome_EmoteResponse_01	Why don't you lean over and say that to my face.
VO_DALA_BOSS_19h_Female_Gnome_DefeatPlayer_01	You just weren't cut out for this.
VO_DALA_BOSS_19h_Female_Gnome_HeroPower_01	Just a little cut.
VO_DALA_BOSS_19h_Female_Gnome_HeroPower_03	Papercuts. Papercuts.
VO_DALA_BOSS_19h_Female_Gnome_HeroPower_04	This is gonna sting. Forever.
VO_DALA_BOSS_19h_Female_Gnome_HeroPowerCombo_01	Cut 'em down to size!
VO_DALA_BOSS_19h_Female_Gnome_HeroPowerCombo_02	Hit 'em with the one-two cut!
VO_DALA_BOSS_19h_Female_Gnome_HeroPowerCombo_03	Twice the pain, but mostly the humiliation.
VO_DALA_BOSS_19h_Female_Gnome_BossCombo_01	Make with the cutty-choppy!
VO_DALA_BOSS_19h_Female_Gnome_BossCombo_02	One of these and... one of those! Hya!
VO_DALA_BOSS_19h_Female_Gnome_PlayerEviscerate_01	Show off.
VO_DALA_BOSS_19h_Female_Gnome_PlayerSmallWeapon_01	Size matters not.
VO_DALA_BOSS_19h_Female_Gnome_BossEdwin_01	Let's get 'em Edwin!
VO_DALA_BOSS_19h_Female_Gnome_Idle_01	Been a bit since my glory days out in Hillsbrad.
VO_DALA_BOSS_19h_Female_Gnome_Idle_02	You keep thinking, I'll keep sharpening.
VO_DALA_BOSS_19h_Female_Gnome_Idle_03	I should visit Albin for another set of daggers...

VO_DALA_BOSS_20h_Male_Troll_Intro_01	You're about ta see how explosive de elements can be!
VO_DALA_BOSS_20h_Male_Troll_EmoteResponse_01	Quiet now, it'll all be over soon.
VO_DALA_BOSS_20h_Male_Troll_DefeatPlayer_01	Ya had no chance against this storm.
VO_DALA_BOSS_20h_Male_Troll_HeroPowerTrigger_01	Let's do that again, Elements!
VO_DALA_BOSS_20h_Male_Troll_HeroPowerTrigger_02	Got a big storm brewin' here!
VO_DALA_BOSS_20h_Male_Troll_HeroPowerTrigger_03	Kaboom! Let's do that again!
VO_DALA_BOSS_20h_Male_Troll_Idle_01	Gonna keep me waitin'?
VO_DALA_BOSS_20h_Male_Troll_Idle_02	Why the bad guys always wantin' to attack Dalaran?
VO_DALA_BOSS_20h_Male_Troll_Idle_03	Weather's pretty nice for a big fight.
VO_DALA_BOSS_20h_Male_Troll_OverloadPass_01	I'm a bit tapped out here, mon.
VO_DALA_BOSS_20h_Male_Troll_OverloadPass_02	Guess I'd best be takin' a break.
VO_DALA_BOSS_20h_Male_Troll_OverloadPass_03	Whew. I need to catch my breath.
VO_DALA_BOSS_20h_Male_Troll_BossLightningSpell_01	Lightning CAN strike twice!
VO_DALA_BOSS_20h_Male_Troll_BossLavaBurst_01	Let's double the heat of dis one!
VO_DALA_BOSS_20h_Male_Troll_PlayerShamanSpell_01	Ah, you be wieldin' the storm as well!
VO_DALA_BOSS_20h_Male_Troll_PlayerRainOfToads_01	OVERTOAD!
VO_DALA_BOSS_20h_Male_Troll_BossClearOverload_01	Here comes da thunda!
VO_DALA_BOSS_20h_Male_Troll_BossClearOverload_03	The storm swells!

VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_Intro_02	I know exactly where this is going.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_EmoteResponse_02	Hmmm. Trust me, I know.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_Death_02	This... was expected!
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_DefeatPlayer_01	I told you I knew.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_HeroPower_01	Shhh. It's a secret. To you.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_HeroPower_03	And... yes, that is what I expected.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_HeroPower_04	Wait... well, that'll do
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_StartOfTurnPrediction_01	Soon the secrets of the Paladins will reveal theirselves.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_StartOfTurnPrediction_02	The future holds whispers of the Hunters.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_StartOfTurnPrediction_03	I have forseen the secrets of the Mages.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_WrongPrediction_01	Just... not right now.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_WrongPrediction_03	I- we're all Hunters in our own way.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_WrongPrediction_04	The bow Mages of course. Yes, that's what I meant.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_CorrectPrediction_01	Behold the mysteries of the light.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_CorrectPrediction_03	Yes yes, those whispers I spoke of.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_CorrectPrediction_04	And there they are!
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_Idle_01	I have foreseen that I'd misforesee things as well.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_Idle_02	It does get a bit boring knowing what's to come.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_Idle_03	Thankfully, I always know what's for lunch.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_PlayerSecret_01	Let's just say, I know what you're up to.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_PlayerSecret_02	I see right through you. Not literally though.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_PlayerCairne_01	Cain? Nope just Cairne.
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_PlayerETC_01	Are you the cow king?
VO_DALA_BOSS_21h_Male_Human_Death_02	This... was expected!

VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_Intro_01	Let me guess, you forgot your library card?
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_IntroTekahn_01	I only have a few tomes... Mostly books!
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_IntroChu_02	T-These aren't for sale!
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_IntroGeorge_01	Did you have your Library card revoked or something?
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_IntroOlBarkeye_01	What are you doing here? Can you even read?
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_IntroRakanishu_01	These are not for burning!
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_EmoteResponse_01	Can you please keep your voice down?
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_DefeatPlayer_01	Unlike a good book, I am happy to put YOU down!
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_HeroPower_01	Shhhh! This is a library!
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_HeroPower_02	People are trying to read!
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_HeroPower_03	Can you not steal in peace?!
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_HeroPower_04	Shuhuuushhsh!
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_PlayerBattlecry_01	Why are your friends so loud?!
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_PlayerBattlecry_02	Keep your voice down!
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_PlayerBabblingBook_01	Even your BOOKS are babbling?!
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_PlayerLegendary_01	No music in the library!
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_PlayerLegendary_02	Turn that thing down!
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_Idle_01	Please fight more... quietly.

VO_DALA_BOSS_28h_Male_Ethereal_DefeatPlayer_01	I was told this would be more difficult.
VO_DALA_BOSS_28h_Male_Ethereal_Idle_01	Have you come to speak with the Nine?
VO_DALA_BOSS_28h_Male_Ethereal_Idle_02	I see between the galaxies.
VO_DALA_BOSS_28h_Male_Ethereal_Idle_03	There is much your future holds that remains unseen.
VO_DALA_BOSS_28h_Male_Ethereal_Idle_04	I was not sent here to wait around.
VO_DALA_BOSS_28h_Male_Ethereal_Idle_05	I suppose we shall unravel some of the mysteries of time while we wait.
VO_DALA_BOSS_28h_Male_Ethereal_HeroPowerBoss_01	That works for me.
VO_DALA_BOSS_28h_Male_Ethereal_HeroPowerBoss_02	That one got away from me.
VO_DALA_BOSS_28h_Male_Ethereal_HeroPowerBoss_03	Chaos does have a purpose.
VO_DALA_BOSS_28h_Male_Ethereal_HeroPowerPlayer_01	Was that what you intended? Hm.
VO_DALA_BOSS_28h_Male_Ethereal_HeroPowerPlayer_02	It's for your happiness.
VO_DALA_BOSS_28h_Male_Ethereal_HeroPowerPlayer_03	I trust that is what you wanted?
VO_DALA_BOSS_28h_Male_Ethereal_PlayerCoin_01	Ah, a coin. How curious.
VO_DALA_BOSS_28h_Male_Ethereal_PlayerDarkness_01	Before the Darkness, there was the Light
VO_DALA_BOSS_28h_Male_Ethereal_PlayerLegendaryWeapon_01	Quite an exotic weapon you've got your hands on.
VO_DALA_BOSS_28h_Male_Ethereal_PlayerLegendaryWeapon_02	Nice legendary. I'll trade you for some of my more exotic wares.
VO_DALA_BOSS_28h_Male_Ethereal_9Cost_TurnNine_01	Hm, another Agent of the Nine perhaps? Interesting...
VO_DALA_BOSS_28h_Male_Ethereal_Death_02	This is but one end…

VO_DALA_BOSS_29h_Female_Dwarf_Idle_01	This is hard work, but I don't mind. It's fun!
VO_DALA_BOSS_29h_Female_Dwarf_Idle_02	I've been diggin out these sewers for years. Careful you don't get lost.
VO_DALA_BOSS_29h_Female_Dwarf_Idle_03	It's been a while since I got in a scuffle. I kinda miss it.
VO_DALA_BOSS_29h_Female_Dwarf_PlayerElemental_01	I bet there's all kinds of goodies inside that one.
VO_DALA_BOSS_29h_Female_Dwarf_PlayerSmallElemental_01	I hardly want to waste a swing on that one.
VO_DALA_BOSS_29h_Female_Dwarf_PlayerSmallElemental_02	Look at the wee little elemental. Hold it still for me.
VO_DALA_BOSS_29h_Female_Dwarf_PlayerPickaxe_01	Y'know, maybe I was wrong about you.

VO_DALA_BOSS_31h_Male_Human_HeroPower_01	This one could be a bit more... beautiful!
VO_DALA_BOSS_31h_Male_Human_HeroPower_02	Would look a lot better in gold.
VO_DALA_BOSS_31h_Male_Human_HeroPower_03	Let's class things up a bit more.
VO_DALA_BOSS_31h_Male_Human_HeroPower_04	This goes with my outfit better.

VO_DALA_BOSS_31h_Male_Human_PlayerAuctioneer_01	Oh no no, these are not for sale.
VO_DALA_BOSS_31h_Male_Human_Idle_01	Does my hair look OK?
VO_DALA_BOSS_31h_Male_Human_Idle_02	You villains could accessorize better, at the very least.
VO_DALA_BOSS_31h_Male_Human_Idle_03	Your outfit is rags and bags. Get a grip.
VO_DALA_BOSS_31h_Male_Human_BossBlessingOfKings_01	An outfit fit for a king!
VO_DALA_BOSS_31h_Male_Human_PlayerBlingtron3000_01	Now that's a mech with a sense of style!
VO_DALA_BOSS_31h_Male_Human_TurnOne_01	Maybe I could find you something more... beautiful?
VO_DALA_BOSS_31h_Male_Human_PlayerTreasure_01	At least you've got some bling on you.

VO_DALA_BOSS_32h_Female_Goblin_Intro_01	Look what the cat dragged in. Here for a CUT?
VO_DALA_BOSS_32h_Female_Goblin_IntroEudora_01	You could use a little off the top, couldn't ya?
VO_DALA_BOSS_32h_Female_Goblin_IntroRakanishu_01	You're lookin' a little... hot headed.
VO_DALA_BOSS_32h_Female_Goblin_EmoteResponse_01	You don't intimidate me.
VO_DALA_BOSS_32h_Female_Goblin_DefeatPlayer_01	Guess I'm a cut above!
VO_DALA_BOSS_32h_Female_Goblin_HeroPower_01	Snip snip... snip snip...
VO_DALA_BOSS_32h_Female_Goblin_HeroPower_02	Snip snip... whoops!
VO_DALA_BOSS_32h_Female_Goblin_HeroPower_03	What a luxurious mane!
VO_DALA_BOSS_32h_Female_Goblin_HeroPower_04	Not much to work with...
VO_DALA_BOSS_32h_Female_Goblin_HeroPowerFade_01	Here's something sleek and elegant.

VO_DALA_BOSS_35h_Female_Human_PlayerHolyNova_01	Ooh. Bit of help and a bit of hurt. I like it!
VO_DALA_BOSS_35h_Female_Human_PlayerShadowForm_01	Given up on helping already? What a shame.
VO_DALA_BOSS_35h_Female_Human_BossSpellNotHeal_01	A healer's got to have more than one trick up their sleeve.
VO_DALA_BOSS_35h_Female_Human_BossFungalEnchanter_02	Aww, look at this novice.

VO_DALA_BOSS_36h_Male_Dwarf_PlayerZombeast_01	I don't like the look of that one.
VO_DALA_BOSS_36h_Male_Dwarf_PlayerZombeast_02	Your pet looks a wee bit sick.
VO_DALA_BOSS_36h_Male_Dwarf_PlayerZombeast_04	Oh that's just wrong.

VO_DALA_BOSS_36h_Male_Dwarf_PlayerSSS_02	You let it run around like that?
VO_DALA_BOSS_36h_Male_Dwarf_PlayerBeast_01	Bah, that one's boring.
VO_DALA_BOSS_36h_Male_Dwarf_PlayerBeast_02	It's no fun unless they're exotic!
VO_DALA_BOSS_36h_Male_Dwarf_PlayerBeast_03	That one might work... for a first pet.
VO_DALA_BOSS_36h_Male_Dwarf_PlayerBigBeast_01	Alright, that one's a bit impressive.
VO_DALA_BOSS_36h_Male_Dwarf_PlayerBigBeast_02	Whoa. You got a big enough leash for that?
VO_DALA_BOSS_36h_Male_Dwarf_PlayerSmallBeast_01	Oh look at the wee thing. It's darn adorable.
VO_DALA_BOSS_36h_Male_Dwarf_PlayerSmallBeast_02	Can.... Can I pet it?

VO_DALA_BOSS_36h_Male_Dwarf_PlayerHuffer_01	Always Huffer.
VO_DALA_BOSS_36h_Male_Dwarf_Idle_01	Oh no, I think I forgot to feed my Chameleon Devilsaur...
VO_DALA_BOSS_36h_Male_Dwarf_Idle_02	Be careful with your smaller minions. I can't promise their safety...
VO_DALA_BOSS_36h_Male_Dwarf_Idle_03	I wonder what I should import next...

VO_DALA_BOSS_50h_Female_Dragon_Intro_01	Dragons, protect Dalaran!
VO_DALA_BOSS_50h_Female_Dragon_EmoteResponse_01	What's that? I can't hear you up here.
VO_DALA_BOSS_50h_Female_Dragon_Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_DALA_BOSS_50h_Female_Dragon_DefeatPlayer_01	Your time was up as soon as you challenged a dragon.
VO_DALA_BOSS_50h_Female_Dragon_HeroPower_02	Time to burn!
VO_DALA_BOSS_50h_Female_Dragon_HeroPower_03	<_Roar_>
VO_DALA_BOSS_50h_Female_Dragon_HeroPower_09	You are nothing!
VO_DALA_BOSS_50h_Female_Dragon_Idle_02	Bronze dragons usually aren't one to complain about waiting, but...
VO_DALA_BOSS_50h_Female_Dragon_Idle_03	I'm not a young dragon anymore, you know...
VO_DALA_BOSS_50h_Female_Dragon_Idle_05	Hm? Is there someone in my teeth?
VO_DALA_BOSS_50h_Female_Dragon_PlayerDragon_01	Traitorous whelp! These are not your allies!

VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Female_Gnome_TurnTwo_01	Where... are... you... hiding him?
VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Female_Gnome_DefeatPlayer_01	Time to light the squirrels and get out of here!

VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Female_Gnome_PlayerMillhouseManastorm_03	You left me to ROT in that cell. HOW COULD YOU?
VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Female_Gnome_PlayerMillhouseManastormDies_01	Just what he deserved. Now you... You're next.
VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Female_Gnome_MillhouseShuffle_01	There's nowhere you can hide from me, Millhouse. HEAR ME? NOWHERE.
VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Female_Gnome_MillhouseSecond_01	TWO of my husband? You're just making it WORSE!
VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Female_Gnome_MillhouseFullBoard_01	<_Scream_>
VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Female_Gnome_BossMillhouse_01	GET THIS FILTH OUT OF MY HANDS.
VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Female_Gnome_Death_02	No! I won't go back!

VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Male_Gnome_IntroA_01	Violet Hold? Where's the tour guide? Oh. No. Oh no.
VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Male_Gnome_IntroA_02	Violet Hold! Now this brings me back. I... Uh oh.
VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Male_Gnome_IntroB_01	Milly, dearie... You! Evil looking adventurer, take care of her! I'm off to hide!
VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Male_Gnome_PlayMillhouse_01	NO no, put me back in your hand.
VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Male_Gnome_PlayMillhouse_02	Wait wait wait!
VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Male_Gnome_PlayMillhouse_03	No no no! Stop stop stop!
VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Male_Gnome_DrawMillhouse_01	It was so dark and cozy in there!
VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Male_Gnome_DrawMillhouse_02	Think of the ramifications for playing me! It's not worth it!
VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Male_Gnome_DrawMillhouse_03	What?! How'd you even find me in here?!
VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Male_Gnome_DefeatInPlay_01	Whew! Let's just put her back into the hold.
VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Male_Gnome_DefeatInPlay_02	Looks like everything's coming up Millhouse!
VO_DALA_BOSS_51h_Female_Gnome_Death_01	No! I won't go back!

VO_DALA_BOSS_52h_Female_Human_Intro_01	Why me? Why. Me?
VO_DALA_BOSS_52h_Female_Human_IntroChu_01	Yeah. That's my job.
VO_DALA_BOSS_52h_Female_Human_EmoteResponse_01	You're giving me a headache.
VO_DALA_BOSS_52h_Female_Human_DefeatPlayer_01	The Violet Hold will... hold, I guess.
VO_DALA_BOSS_52h_Female_Human_HeroPower_01	Consider yourself promoted.
VO_DALA_BOSS_52h_Female_Human_HeroPower_02	To arms. We'll push them back!
VO_DALA_BOSS_52h_Female_Human_HeroPower_03	Hold fast. We can do it.
VO_DALA_BOSS_52h_Female_Human_HeroPower_04	You will not be forgotten!
VO_DALA_BOSS_52h_Female_Human_HeroPower_06	You're the best we've got...
VO_DALA_BOSS_52h_Female_Human_Idle_01	It's always when I'm on duty.
VO_DALA_BOSS_52h_Female_Human_Idle_02	First demons, now these repugnant villains.
VO_DALA_BOSS_52h_Female_Human_Idle_03	Surely some other guards should be here by now.
VO_DALA_BOSS_52h_Female_Human_PlayerMasterPlan_01	Well. Now we all know what you're planning.
VO_DALA_BOSS_52h_Female_Human_PlayerAnnoyotron_01	Ugh. As if you weren't annoying enough.
VO_DALA_BOSS_52h_Female_Human_PlayerAnnoyohorn_01	Are you... kidding me?!
VO_DALA_BOSS_52h_Female_Human_BossBuffMinion_01	C'mon then. Put your backs into it.
VO_DALA_BOSS_52h_Female_Human_BossVioletWarden_02	Can you deal with these intruders? 
VO_DALA_BOSS_52h_Female_Human_BossVioletSpellsword_01	I could use your blade.

VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_EmoteResponse_01	Hey! Lock your mouth, and throw away the key.
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_DefeatPlayer_01	Hahah! Guess you're locked in here with me forever!
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_HeroPowerTrigger_01	Those crystals are now off limits.
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_HeroPowerTrigger_02	Pad 'em up!
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_HeroPowerTriggerPlayer_01	Think of it like this, I'm just keepin' them safe!
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_HeroPowerTriggerPlayer_02	You're not gonna need that mana anyways.
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_HeroPowerTriggerPlayer_03	I'll unlock those crystals for you. For just seven easy payments of 99 gold.
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_BossOverloadPass_01	I must have the key here somewhere...
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_BossOverloadPass_02	This is one lock I just can't crack.
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_BossBigSpell_01	This one is worth throwin' away the key for.
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_Idle_02	Sometimes you just have to think about a problem. And then smack it with somethin'.
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_Idle_03	The Kirin Tor aren't exactly comfortable with the whole magical locksmith thing.
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_Idle_04	Have you tried checking under your deck for a spare key?
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_BossLavaShock_01	The key? A little lava grease.
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_BossLavaShock_02	A key for every situation.
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_PlayerLackey_01	Lackey? But I got the keys right here!
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_PlayerBigSpell_01	I hope that was worth it, because I’m locking that mana up.
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_PlayerSafeguard_01	Back in my prime I'd crack that baby in 5 seconds flat.
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_PlayerWagglePick_01	That ain't a lockpick I've ever seen!
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_PlayerUnlockMana_01	Hey-hey! Now that's someone who knows their way around a lock!
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_PlayerUnlockMana_02	Wait a minute, you're musclin' in on my turf over here!
VO_DALA_BOSS_54h_Male_Goblin_Exposition_01	I used to unlock doors of considerable wealth for some bad folks too.

VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_Intro_01	Halt where you stand, miscreant filth.
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_IntroGeorge_01	Surely a Paladin would have better sense than to attack Dalaran?!
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_EmoteResponse_01	You can't talk your way out of this one!
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_DefeatPlayer_01	To the stockades with you!

VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_HeroPowerMany_01	They're cornered! Push forward!
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_HeroPowerMany_02	Strength in numbers!
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_HeroPowerMany_03	Keep at it, the enemy will be forced to surrender!
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_HeroPowerFull_01	Send in an even larger guard!
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_Idle_01	You're out of options. Surrender now.
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_Idle_02	Remain silent, and come with us.
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_Idle_03	I've been on this beat for 20 years and never seen something like this before.
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_PlayerHyperblaster_01	They're armed and dangerous! Look out!
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_PlayerBigBoomba_02	Hit the deck!
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_PlayerLackey_01	There they are! Grab them!
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_PlayerVillainLegendary_01	It's one of the masterminds! Arrest them!
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_BossWeaponEquip_01	I'll just have to handle this myself!
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_BossIronforgePortal_01	We've got backup coming in from Ironforge!
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_PlayerVioletWarden_01	Traitor! You turn against your own city?!
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_TurnOne_02	Your rampage through the streets ends here.
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_Exposition_01	You made a big mistake making trouble in my jurisdiction.
VO_DALA_BOSS_55h_Male_Human_Exposition_02	Stealing Dalaran... what a preposterous plan!

VO_DALA_BOSS_56h_Female_Kobold_HeroPowerWeak_01	Ohoho. So weakling! Like you!
VO_DALA_BOSS_56h_Female_Kobold_HeroPowerWeak_02	This is not being worth my time.
VO_DALA_BOSS_56h_Female_Kobold_HeroPowerWeak_03	This is not being worth my time.

VO_DALA_BOSS_56h_Female_Kobold_PlayerTogwaggle_01	You take deck? I take deck TWICE.
VO_DALA_BOSS_56h_Female_Kobold_PlayerTogwaggle_02	Bah. Tiny treasure. Not even sparkling!
VO_DALA_BOSS_56h_Female_Kobold_PlayerDarkness_01	So many candles on head. You thinking me be scared?

VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_Intro_01	You steal from Dalaran, you steal from ME.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_IntroChu_01	Oooh sorry. Let me step aside so you CAN STEAL FROM ME.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_IntroEudora_01	Couldn't they have hired a REAL pirate for this job?
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_IntroVessina_01	I've met a lot of snakes in my day, but this one takes the cake!
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_EmoteResponse_02	Time is money. So you're wasting my money. And I don't like that.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_DefeatPlayer_01	My bank is saved! Oh yeah, and the city.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_HeroPower_02	Oh this was worth it. So worth it.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_HeroPower_03	Greed. Is good.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_HeroPower_04	Yeah, yeah I'll take one of those.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_HeroPower_05	I'll buy it nice and CHEAP.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_HeroPower_06	Buy yourself something nice with that.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_HeroPower_07	I'VE got the best deals, anywhere.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_HeroPowerFull_01	I'd buy that from you, but my hands are full over here.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_HeroPowerFull_02	Oh you think you're so clever, eh? I didn't even want it.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_HeroPowerFull_03	Okay wise guy. That'll end up biting you where the sun don't shine.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_Idle_01	Do you have any idea how much I've... "Invested" in this place?
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_Idle_02	They don't call me the Trade Prince for nothing here, capiche?
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_Idle_04	Look, I got a business to run. Hurry things up.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_Idle_05	I've dealt with crooks before, you're no worse.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_PlayerTreasure_01	You're gonna sell that to me? For a coin? Nice.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_PlayerTreasure_02	I don't want to say you're making a mistake here but…
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_BossTreasure_01	Really, I gotta thank you for this one.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_BossTreasure_02	I hope it was worth it for you. Not really.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_PlayerTradePrince_01	My my my, what a handsome portrayal of gluttony.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_PlayerCoinFirst_01	That's an even trade.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_PlayerCoin_02	It always pains me to see others WASTE their money.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_PlayerCoin_03	I turned a coin into an empire. Yet you waste yours on CARDS.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_PlayerBurgle_01	HEY HEY! Get your filthy hands out of my POCKETS!
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_PlayerPickPocket_01	Are you some kind of kleptomaniacal lowlife?
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_PlayerGallywixCoin_01	You're welcome.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_PlayerGallywixCoin_02	You're welcome.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_PlayerGallywixCoin_03	See? You got something out of this deal.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_PlayerCoinIntoNothing_01	That's it? I don't get it.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_PlayerBad_01	This has been the worst deal in the history of Azeroth.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_PlayerBagOfCoins_01	That has gotta be the best deal I've ever made.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_PlayerFlyBy_01	A gambling type, eh? I like your style!
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_Misc_02	The odds are not in your favor.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_Misc_03	It's almost like I'm cheating.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_Misc_04	I'm always three steps ahead. Or in your case, fifty or so.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_Exposition_Story_01	These mages SAID it would be impossible to crack this vault.
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_Exposition_Story_02	But what do I see here? A whole crew of crooks standing in front of me!
VO_DALA_BOSS_57h_Male_Goblin_Exposition_Story_03	I don't usually like to get my hands dirty, but I gotta protect my investments!

VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_Intro_01	Don't step any closer! I'll do it!!
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_IntroRakanishu_01	C'mere little flame. I got a fuse to light!
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_IntroEudora_01	What a relief! You look nice and flammable.
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_EmoteResponse_01	Oh sure, now you wanna talk.
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_Death_02	BOOM BABY!
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_DefeatPlayer_02	Aw, now you're gonna miss the fireworks!
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_HeroPower_01	Patented BOOMMASTER dust!
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_HeroPower_02	Careful now, move too fast and, well. Boom.
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_HeroPower_03	All it takes is a little spark.
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_HeroPower_04	You might wanna avoid any nearby flames.
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_HeroPower_05	That minion? It's gonna explode. I made sure of it.
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_HeroPower_06	You are not cleaning that off, trust me.
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_HeroPowerSilence_01	Well... That's one way to save 'em.
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_Idle_01	I'm getting a little antsy here...
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_Idle_02	There are a couple of fuses lit already, you might wanna hurry.
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_Idle_03	There are a couple of fuses lit already, you might wanna hurry.
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_Idle_04	Ah yeah sure take your time. Take your time.
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_WiresTrigger_01	ZAP ZAP BOOM!
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_WiresTrigger_02	BOOM!
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_WiresTrigger_03	BOOM!
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_WiresTrigger_04	Oh that's gotta hurt!
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_WiresTrigger_05	Keep 'em touching!
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_WiresTrigger_08	Oooh, whoops. Did you cut the red wire?
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_WiresTrigger_09	No no no, it's the BLUE wire!
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_TurnOne_01	Wait why did I give you the wires. MAKE 'EM TOUCH!
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_TurnOne_02	Dr. Boom sent you, didn't he? He wouldn't understand.
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_TurnTwo_01	It used to be about the explosions man. What happened?
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_TurnFour_01	Why steal the city, when you can just BLOW IT UP INSTEAD?
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_TurnSix_01	You have one more chance: help me blow this rock to bits!
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_BossGoblinBombs_01	These are a classic! I shoulda made millions on these!
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_BossShuffleBomb_01	What's wrong? I thought you were lookin' for bombs!
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_BossDrawBomb_01	Wait wait, you put bombs in MY deck?! That's not fair!
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_PlayerBoomzooka_01	You have mighty fine taste in weaponry!
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_PlayerBoommasterFlark_01	Another one of those clones from Zerek! When is he gonna quit it?
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_PlayerDrBoom_01	Dr. Boom? More like Dr. STEAL DALARAN.
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_PlayerBoombots_01	Oh a classic. Still holds up today.
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_PlayerGoblinBombs_01	Shoulda been MY face on those bombs.
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_PlayerFlyBy_01	Bombs, in the sky. It's a dream come true.
VO_DALA_BOSS_58h_Male_Goblin_Death_02	BOOM BABY!

VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_Intro_01	I know who you are. I know what you've done.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_IntroChu_01	Mister Chu. You know the price for betraying me.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_IntroGeorge_01	Revenge is a costly pursuit.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_EmoteResponse_01	Speak carefully. These may be your last words.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_DefeatPlayer_01	Very disappointing.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_HeroPower_01	You will pay what you owe. One way, or another.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_HeroPower_02	There is a price on that.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_HeroPower_03	The black market takes a modest cut.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_HeroPower_04	Think of this as an investment in our future relationship.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_HeroPower_05	The invisible paw of the market at work.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_HeroPower_06	Items have a way of increasing price at the worst of times.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_HeroPowerTreasure_01	What a curious artifact. I will hold onto it for you.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_HeroPowerTreasure_02	This item has great meaning to you. I hope I do not drop it.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_PlayerExtortion_01	Perhaps you are not the fool I took you to be.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_PlayerExtortion_02	A welcome exchange.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_PlayerExtortion_03	How wise of you.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_PlayerExtortion_04	Thank you for your continued patronage.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_PlayerExtortion_05	Some say money cannot buy happiness. They lie.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_PlayerExtortion_06	A small price to pay.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_Idle_01	Bide your time.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_Idle_02	I deal with criminals. You are nothing more than simple thugs.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_Idle_03	The wheels in your head turn, yet... nothing.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_PlayerMadamGoya_01	An image of myself? How peculiar.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_PlayerDonHancho_01	Han'Cho, I hope you found your purchases to be to your liking.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_PlayerAyaBlackpaw_01	Aya my dear. The jade in your eyes, still shines just as bright.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_PlayerKazakus_01	Kazakus. Do not to bite the paw that feeds.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_PlayerJade_01	I see my wares have found a home.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_PlayerJade_02	Seeing Aya's work always fills me with pride.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_PlayerJade_03	Jade. Truly beautiful.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_BossLotusBruiser_01	Sometimes force is necessary.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_BossLotusBruiser_02	A bit blunt for my tastes, but he does good work.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_BossFruitNinja_01	Ninja get results.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_StartOfGame_01	Dalaran is an important place of business for me.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_Misc_01	Those who stand to hinder me, do not stand for long.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_Misc_02	This city is not going anywhere. I will make sure of it.
VO_DALA_BOSS_59h_Female_Pandaren_Death_02	Oh. I lost.

VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_Intro_01	You tell Rafaam his plan is finished. 
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_EmoteResponse_01	Odd time to chat, but... hello!
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_DefeatPlayer_01	Rafaam!! Show yourself! You're not getting away...
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_DefeatPlayer_02	Citizens of Dalaran, raise your eyes to the skies and observe! We are saved!
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_HeroPower_01	These things are so handy.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_HeroPower_02	It'll give you a tour of the city if you like.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_HeroPower_03	I've got tons of these things.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_HeroPower_04	These little guys just LOVE magic.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_Idle_01	Take your time. You're surrounded. And... doomed.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_Idle_02	There's a 'concede' button down there in the corner.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_Idle_03	You're doing well! Was that condescending? Good.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_Trigger_Copyspell_01	Ahh, I needed one of those.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_Trigger_Copyspell_02	Hm, you run with that?
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_Trigger_Copyspell_03	That's a good spell.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_Trigger_Copyspell_04	Wonderful spell, that one.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_Trigger_PlayerPlaysFloatingHead_01	That's one way to get ahead. Haha! A... head.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_Trigger_PlayerSavedByHead_01	I hate that stupid head!
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_Start_01	I've ensured you go first this game!
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_Emptyhand_01	You're in luck. I have some extra cards.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_SaveLife_01	I've got you. I remember when Ice Block was standard.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_Copycard_01	Don't be sad. I put another copy in your deck. 
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_Minionwipe_01	I'm clearing the board! You're welcome.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_RandomLegendary_01	Random legendaries are always good.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_RandomCast_01	Let me cast that again at a random target.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_FatigueReset_01	That's too much fatigue. Let me fix that.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_Fatigue_01	Next time, bring more cards to the fight.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_DrawExtra_01	Go ahead, draw another. Nobody's looking.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_SpellCast_01	That's a great spell. We should cast it again!
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_SelfDamage_01	Here's a winning tip: Stop hitting yourself!
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_MirrorImage_01	This will protect you!
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_CostRandomizer_01	Let me adjust the cost of that for you. 
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_FreeMinions_01	I've added a few minions to your hand. No need to thank me.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_Treasure_01	I love a good treasure! Let's look for more.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_ExtraTurn_01	Have you tried taking an extra turn?
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_ExtraMana_01	That guy started with extra mana! You should too.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_FreezeMinions_01	Do you feel a chill?
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_HealPlayer_01	You know, running out of "Health" makes you lose.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_FloatingHead_Trigger_CopyCards_01	Take a couple extra copies. That boss won't mind.
VO_DALA_BOSS_60h_Male_Human_Death_03	The city...

VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_Intro_01	You're never going to leave!
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_EmoteResponse_01	Talking won't save you.
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_DefeatPlayer_01	You can't leave, you can NEVER LEAVE!
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_HeroPower_01	Come out and play...
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_HeroPower_02	What is caught in my web?
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_HeroPower_03	Come, come, come...
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_HeroPower_04	What is hiding in here?
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_HeroPower_05	Oh my, what a treat. Hahah.
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_HeroPowerNothing_01	Hmm? Where is my next meal?
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_HeroPowerNothing_02	Aww, did I eat all of your friends?
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_HeroPowerPhaseSpider_01	That's not supposed to be there! 
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_Idle_01	My spiders are hungry...
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_Idle_02	You can't get away, you're mine!
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_Idle_03	Don't keep me waiting too long.
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_BossPhaseSpiderKill_01	Look away...
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_BossSpreadingPlague_01	For the swarm!
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_PlayerSprint_01	Run, heh, it's fun to watch you run!
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_PlayerPsychicScream_01	Your screams are funny!
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_PlayerWebspinner_01	What is caught in your web, spider?
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_PlayerBallOfSpiders_02	You will not take my nest from me!
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_BossPhaseSpider_01	Along came a spider...
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_BossPhaseSpider_02	Don't look behind you!
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_BossPhaseSpider_03	An itsy bitsy spider...
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_BossPhaseSpider_04	Can you see them? They see you.
VO_DALA_BOSS_61h_Female_Aranasi_BossPhaseSpider_05	Keep your eyes open...


VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_Intro_01	Your light will fade.
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_IntroGeorge_01	Shadows have already fallen on you.
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_IntroTekahn_01	There is no light within you. Your soul is ash.
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_EmoteResponse_01	You may say that now...
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_DefeatPlayer_01	Dusk to dusk.
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_HeroPower_01	Shadows swirl...
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_HeroPower_02	Are you afraid of the dark?
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_HeroPower_03	No light...
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_HeroPower_04	Darkness engulfs.
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_HeroPower_05	The sun sets... 
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_PlayerTheDarkness_01	Hello, my old friend...
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_PlayerSunwalker_01	An easy target.
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_PlayerParagonofLight_01	You shall be snuffed out.
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_PlayerEmbracetheShadow_01	I... did not foresee this.
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_Idle_01	Through the Light's teachings, I have found my place within the dark.
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_Idle_02	The stronger the Light, the deeper the shadows.
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_Idle_03	There are two sides to everything - including the Light.
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_PlayerLichKing_01	I'm not the only one who has seen both sides, then.
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_PlayerShadowform_01	Let the darkness in. Bathe in it.
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_PlayerRenounceDarkness_01	Abandoning either side is a mistake. Bask in both.
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_BossHorror_01	There are many terrors that go bump in the night...
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_BossStealMinion_01	Come to the dark side...
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_BossStealMinion_02	The light can make one grow weary. Come...
VO_DALA_BOSS_62h_Male_Tauren_BossNoAttack_01	The shadows have grown too dark. Perhaps some light is needed.

VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_Intro_01	You are not long for this world.
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_EmoteResponse_01	You know it's nice to have someone to talk to.
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_DefeatPlayer_01	Hahahahaha!
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_HeroPower_01	You'll never amount to anything!
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_HeroPower_02	Worthless! Pathetic!
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_HeroPower_03	The strong trample the weak!
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_HeroPower_04	Be crushed beneath my might!
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_HeroPower_06	You will be forgotten!
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_HeroPower_07	Tremble and BREAK!
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_HeroPower_08	I will flatten you beneath my boots.
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_HeroPowerRare_01	I'm just projecting my issues onto YOU!
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_HeroPowerRare_02	I'm angry because of low self ESTEEM!
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_HeroPowerRare_03	I'm jealous that your minions are BETTER!
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_Idle_01	What do I yell at next...
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_Idle_02	I feel like my insults have been lacking lately...
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_Idle_03	Oh I had a great one lined up this morning...
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_PlayerDevestate_01	Yeah! Get 'em! They were weak anyways!
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_PlayerInnerRage_01	Seeth with rage!
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_PlayerDragon_01	Hiding behind a big ol' beast, huh?
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_BossBrawl_01	Fight! Fight! Fight!
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_BossBigWeapon_01	I-I'm not compensating for anything...
VO_DALA_BOSS_63h_Male_Orc_PlayerBurglyBully_01	Oh hey Billy! How's the bullying going?

VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_Intro_01	Sorry, this one's not for sale.
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_IntroGeorge_01	You're here to cause trouble.
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_IntroChu_01	I gave up your life style long ago.
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_EmoteResponse_01	Stop interrupting my work!
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_DefeatPlayer_01	Be sure to diversify your cards next time.
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_HeroPower_01	Ah, this one is on the rise.
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_HeroPower_04	Gonna wanna go in on this one.
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_HeroPower_05	Putting a big stack on this one!
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_HeroPower_06	Low risk. High rewards.
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_HeroPower_07	A bit of money usually makes things better.
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_HeroPower_08	Putting this away for a rainy day...
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_Idle_02	I need to get transferred back to Orgrimmar.
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_Idle_03	Just looking up your account number...
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_Idle_04	I'm not even supposed to be here today...
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_PlayerBurgle_01	I keep all my funds in a vault.
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_PlayerCoin_01	Oh! Will you be putting that into savings then?
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_PlayerSoldierofFortune_01	Making a BIG deposit, I see!
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_PlayerSafeguard_01	Is that... my savings account?!
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_Exposition_01	People come to me when they want to start REALLY making money.
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_Exposition_02	But your mistake is thinking you can get it the easy way!
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_BossSafeguard_01	This one is Gallywix's. You should know not to mess with HIS money.
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_BossBuffedMinionDies_01	They can't all be winners.
VO_DALA_BOSS_64h_Male_Orc_BossIKnowAGuy_01	I'm calling security!

VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_Intro_01	Come at me!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_IntroTekahn_01	Your armor may be... plentiful, but nothing compared to mine!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_IntroEduora_01	Leather on... leather? Haha! Nothing compared to plate!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_IntroSqueamlish_01	A rat? Eugh. In scraps? EUGH.
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_IntroRakanishu_01	Hah! You wish.
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_EmoteResponse_01	Even your pathetic words fail to penetrate my MASTERWORK armor!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_DefeatPlayer_01	You should consider some better armor, haha!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_HeroPowerTrigger_01	Nuh-uh-ah!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_HeroPowerTrigger_02	Not today, swine!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_HeroPowerTrigger_03	I barely felt a thing!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_HeroPowerTrigger_04	Hmm hmm hmm, la la la!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_HeroPowerTrigger_05	Oh were you... trying? Bahaha!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_HeroPowerTrigger_06	There's a reason I spent a fortune on this set.
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_HeroPowerStopDeath_01	Whew. That was... too close!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_HeroPowerStopDeath_02	Oh. I planned it that way. Haha!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_Idle_01	I'm so... shiny!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_Idle_02	The worst part about this is all the polishing I need to do...
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_Idle_03	I wish I had some flashier cards to go with this armor.
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_PlayerGainArmor_01	That's your armor? Ha!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_PlayerGainArmor_02	That armor is just... is just... embarrassing!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_PlayerGainArmor_03	Did you craft that yourself? Hahaha!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_PlayerPlatedScarabDeathrattle_01	Ha! Nice HAT!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_BossHumility_01	What's wrong? Afraid of my ARMOR?
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_BossEyeforanEye_01	Haha! My armor can even deal damage!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_PlayerAlexstraza_01	You dirty little cheat!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_PlayerOrbOfUntold_01	Cursed orb! It will be my undoing!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_BossLayOnHands_01	I can do more than just sit here and look nice!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_Death_02	How?!
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_Misc_01	Can we wrap this up? I'm heading to Warsong Gulch after this.
VO_DALA_BOSS_65h_Male_HighElf_Misc_02	Are you going to keep trying? Just give up!

VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_Intro_01	Another busy day... Next in line?
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_EmoteResponse_01	Please, don't distract me.
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_DefeatPlayer_01	Try coming back next week, we're closed.
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_HeroPower_01	Next!
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_HeroPower_02	These lines never end.
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_HeroPower_03	No cutting!
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_HeroPower_04	Sorry, this is the wrong line. NEXT!
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_HeroPower_05	Have you filled out Form 489C?
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_HeroPower_06	You'll have to get back in line for this, sorry.
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_HeroPowerEmpty_01	Oh. Guess the line's done.
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_Idle_01	Sure are taking your time.
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_Idle_02	I was still living when this line started. <_Snickers_>
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_Idle_03	Customers keep getting ruder and ruder.
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_PlayerBurnCard_01	Overdrawn? Too bad.
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_BossBurnCard_01	Line's all full.
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_TriggerBomb_01	Just another day at the bank.
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_BossCurseofWeakness_01	Waiting can be sooo tiring, huh?
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_BossBigMinion_01	This one gets to cut in line. They're scary.
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_PlayerLeeroy_01	Hey, hey, hey! You have to wait in line too!
VO_DALA_BOSS_66h_Female_Undead_PlayerRushMinion_01	Listen, EVERYONE is in a rush. I get it!

VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_Intro_01	Your little invasion ends here.
VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_EmoteResponse_01	Know that you babble at an Archmage of the Kirin Tor.
VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_DefeatPlayer_01	Oh, you got SO far, too...
VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_HeroPower_01	This should do nicely.
VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_HeroPower_02	This has always come easily to me.
VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_HeroPower_03	Arcane power, at a moment's notice.
VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_HeroPower_04	I won't hold back.
VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_HeroPower_05	Taste the power, of the Arcane!
VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_Idle_01	Do you know how long it took for me to write these runes?
VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_Idle_02	I could stand to come up with some new Arcane spells.
VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_Idle_03	Why do frost mages get to have all of the fun?
VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_BossArcaneSpell_01	Taste arcane power!
VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_BossArcaneSpell_02	Feel the might of the Kirin Tor!
VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_PlayerArcaneSpell_01	Ah, have you read one of my books?
VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_BossAluneth_01	I represent the power of the Kirin Tor!
VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_BossSpellDamageMinion_01	Even I need assistance casting spells occasionally. 
VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_PlayerKalecgos_01	Kalecgos! Why have you turned against me?
VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_PlayerMalygos_01	We shall bring you down again, Malygos!
VO_DALA_BOSS_67h_Male_Human_PlayerArchmage_01	What order do YOU represent?

VO_DALA_BOSS_68h_Female_BloodElf_Intro_01	I dare not waste effort on the likes of you.
VO_DALA_BOSS_68h_Female_BloodElf_EmoteResponse_01	Your words will be forgotten. Just like you.
VO_DALA_BOSS_68h_Female_BloodElf_DefeatPlayer_01	That was even easier than I thought.
VO_DALA_BOSS_68h_Female_BloodElf_HeroPowerTrigger_02	Come out, come out little ones.
VO_DALA_BOSS_68h_Female_BloodElf_HeroPowerTrigger_03	You never know what can slip through the cracks.
VO_DALA_BOSS_68h_Female_BloodElf_HeroPowerTrigger_04	Don't underestimate them.
VO_DALA_BOSS_68h_Female_BloodElf_HeroPowerTrigger_05	Small things add up quickly.
VO_DALA_BOSS_68h_Female_BloodElf_HeroPowerTrigger_07	This fight is a numbers game. And I'll win.
VO_DALA_BOSS_68h_Female_BloodElf_HeroPowerTrigger_08	You don't deserve a real challenge.
VO_DALA_BOSS_68h_Female_BloodElf_Idle_01	Your kind disgusts me.
VO_DALA_BOSS_68h_Female_BloodElf_Idle_02	Haven't you already caused enough damage?
VO_DALA_BOSS_68h_Female_BloodElf_Idle_03	What value does this floating rock even have to you?
VO_DALA_BOSS_68h_Female_BloodElf_BossPortal_01	Here's something a little bigger.
VO_DALA_BOSS_68h_Female_BloodElf_PlayerPortal_01	So impressive.
VO_DALA_BOSS_68h_Female_BloodElf_Player10CostMinion_01	Well that's certainly more impressive than you.
VO_DALA_BOSS_68h_Female_BloodElf_Player1CostMinion_01	<_Smug Giggle_>

VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_Intro_01	You have reason to be frightened, invader!
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_EmoteResponse_01	In all my years I've never heard such nonsense.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_DefeatPlayer_01	You're going to spend a looong time in the Violet Hold.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_HeroPower_01	Feel the wrath of Kalecgos!
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_HeroPower_02	Tremble before me!
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_HeroPower_03	Behold the might of Dragonwrath!
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_HeroPower_04	This city is under my protection.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_HeroPower_05	You tangle with powers beyond your comprehension.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_HeroPower_06	The arcane bends to my command.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_Idle_01	You seem troubled.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_Idle_02	You shouldn't be wasting time in such circumstances.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_Idle_03	If only Jaina were here...
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_BossSilence_01	I deny your magic.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_PlayerMageSpell_01	You are merely a novice.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_BossAzureDrake_01	Come, my allies. Aid me!
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_BossSpellDamage_01	I will show you the power of the Spell-Weaver.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_PlayerArcaneSpell_01	You have promise. A shame you choose to waste it.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_PlayerArcaneSpell_02	If only you had proper training.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_PlayerAlextrasza_01	Alexstrasza, how have you been?
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_PlayerYsera_01	Ah, Ysera. It is good to see you again.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_PlayerNozdormu_01	The Timeless One flies with us once more.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_PlayerDeathwing_02	You'd ally yourself with the Destroyer? Have you no bounds?
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_PlayerMalygos_01	I've stopped you once Malygos, I will do it again.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_TurnOne_02	You don't understand the consequences of your actions.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_TurnTwo_01	Dalaran is not a toy to steal. People's lives are at stake.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_Exposition_01	Dalaran could have been your home too.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_PlayerDKJaina_01	Jaina?! Well... this is awkward.
VO_DALA_BOSS_69h_Male_Human_PlayerDeathwing_02	You'd ally yourself with the Destroyer? Have you no bounds?

VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_Intro_01	What exactly have I happened upon? Raiders? In Dalaran?
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_IntroEudora_01	There's only room for one captain on this ship.
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_EmoteResponse_02	What'd you say?! I can't hear you!
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_DefeatPlayer_02	Blew you away!
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_HeroPower_01	Fire! Ha-ha!
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_HeroPower_02	All cannons, fire!
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_HeroPower_03	Fire starboard cannons!
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_HeroPower_04	Light those fuses!
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_HeroPower_05	Blow them away!
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_HeroPowerReloading_01	Can't we reload any quicker?
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_HeroPowerReloading_02	Almost ready for another round!
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_HeroPowerReloading_03	Put your back into it!
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_HeroPowerReloading_04	I know we have more cannonballs!
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_Idle_01	Wind's startin' to pick up!
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_Idle_03	Are we out of cannonballs? No? Then keep firing!
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_Idle_04	Let's get going, I've got skies to sail.
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_PlayerPirate_01	You could be sailin' the SKIES with me!
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_PlayerShipCannon_01	Ooh, you brought cannons to a cannon fight!
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_BossBombardmentAOE_02	Haha! Direct hit!
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_BossBombardmentAOEFails_01	That's it? That's all we've got?
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_PlayerFlyBy_01	Look out! We've been boarded!
VO_DALA_BOSS_70h_Male_Human_BossCannonBarrage_01	Load your own cannons and fire!

VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_Intro_01	I guess we will have to do it ourselves.
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_EmoteResponse_01	If a fool speaks in a forest, does anyone hear it?
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_DefeatPlayer_01	Beaten by a lone night elf... and her army of treants.
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_HeroPower_01	Nature stands by my side.
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_HeroPower_02	We shall make mulch out of you.
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_HeroPower_03	Rise, my beautiful trees.
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_HeroPower_04	We shall block your path!
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_HeroPower_05	You will not get through us!
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_HeroPower_06	With deep roots, we will stand firm.
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_Idle_01	What's wrong? Scared of some trees?
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_Idle_02	Why, yes. They are all bark, AND bite.
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_Idle_03	Magic makes the best fertilizer.
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_Idle_04	Are you stumped?
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_PlayerTreant_01	Nature is not yours to toy with.
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_PlayerFlamestrike_01	Go ahead, burn them. More will come!
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_PlayerSap_01	That's no sap I've ever seen...
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_PlayerNaturalize_01	Nature against nature. Most unfortunate.
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_BossSoulOfTheForest_01	You can knock them down... but they will be back.
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_BossTreeSpeaker_01	Make my treants grow!
VO_DALA_BOSS_71h_Female_NightElf_BossForceOfNature_01	My protectors brought some friends...

VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_Intro_01	I'll take care of this one.
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_IntroChu_01	Good luck. I'm heavy.
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_IntroTekahn_01	TolVir. The Curse of Flesh haunts you still.
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_IntroGeorge_01	You'd do well to steel your heart.
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_EmoteResponse_01	Hardy har har.
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_DefeatPlayer_01	What's wrong? Too hard for you?
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_HeroPowerTrigger_01	I feel nothing.
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_HeroPowerTrigger_02	<_Laughing_>
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_HeroPowerTrigger_03	No pain. Still gain.
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_HeroPowerTrigger_05	Flesh to steel.
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_HeroPowerTrigger_06	My body is unbreakable.
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_HeroPowerTrigger_07	Where flesh fails. Steel prevails.
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_BossHellfire_01	Friendly fire? What's that?
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_BossHellfire_02	All others will BURN!
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_PlayerSelfDamage_01	That's gotta sting.
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_PlayerSelfDamage_02	Steel yourself.
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_PlayerSelfDamage_04	Stop hitting yourself.
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_Idle_01	You're stuck between a rock and a hard place.
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_Idle_02	Yes, yes, it IS incredibly difficult to shave.
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_Idle_03	Do you have any idea how long it takes to polish this?
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_PlayerCrystalizer_01	Crystals? Puh.
VO_DALA_BOSS_72h_Male_Orc_PlayerArmor_01	You hide behind your armor. I AM my armor.

VO_DALA_BOSS_73h_Male_Tauren_Intro_01	You do not belong here.
VO_DALA_BOSS_73h_Male_Tauren_Intro_02	You do not belong here.
VO_DALA_BOSS_73h_Male_Tauren_EmoteResponse_01	I cannot hear you over the power of the winds!
VO_DALA_BOSS_73h_Male_Tauren_DefeatPlayer_01	Like dust in the wind.
VO_DALA_BOSS_73h_Male_Tauren_HeroPower_01	Earthmother, grant us strength.
VO_DALA_BOSS_73h_Male_Tauren_HeroPower_02	The Earthmother guides.
VO_DALA_BOSS_73h_Male_Tauren_HeroPower_03	The ferocious winds aid us!
VO_DALA_BOSS_73h_Male_Tauren_HeroPower_04	Feel the fury of the winds!
VO_DALA_BOSS_73h_Male_Tauren_PlayerTotem_02	This false power must be destroyed.
VO_DALA_BOSS_73h_Male_Tauren_PlayerWindfury_01	You do not deserve her strength.
VO_DALA_BOSS_73h_Male_Tauren_PlayerWindfury_02	<_humph_>
VO_DALA_BOSS_73h_Male_Tauren_Idle_01	I must be patient.
VO_DALA_BOSS_73h_Male_Tauren_Idle_02	It is not wise to disturb the winds. They have a way of pushing back.
VO_DALA_BOSS_73h_Male_Tauren_Idle_04	Earthmother speaks to me... wait, no, that's someone else.
VO_DALA_BOSS_73h_Male_Tauren_PlayerShamanSpell_01	The elements serve ME.
VO_DALA_BOSS_73h_Male_Tauren_PlayerVoltron_01	How has a machine mastered the winds?!
VO_DALA_BOSS_73h_Male_Tauren_BossWhirlwindTempest_01	The winds howl! They will crush you!

VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_Intro_01	Oh, look. Another unsavory type.
VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_EmoteResponse_01	Yeah yeah, I get what you're saying.
VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_DefeatPlayer_01	Seems it was worth it, then.
VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_HeroPower_01	A small sacrifice to pay.
VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_HeroPower_02	It's all for the greater good... or evil. Depends who's asking.
VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_HeroPower_03	That was worthwhile.
VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_HeroPower_04	Weaved together from the discarded.
VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_HeroPowerSmall_01	Well, not all souls are high quality.
VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_HeroPowerSmall_02	To think some things have such pitiful souls.
VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_HeroPowerLarge_01	Waste not. Everything has its purpose.
VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_HeroPowerLarge_02	Oh, what a magnificent sight.
VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_Idle_01	What would you sacrifice?
VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_Idle_02	Today I protect Dalaran. Tomorrow? Maybe not.
VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_Idle_03	Good... bad... I'm the girl with the demons.
VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_BossSoulfire_01	Sometimes I go for a more direct approach.
VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_PlayerDiscard_01	See, it's not all bad.
VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_PlayerDiscard_02	I hate to see it wasted. I could've done so much more.
VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_PlayerDemon_01	Oh boy. Beings from the great beyond.
VO_DALA_BOSS_74h_Female_Human_BossEmptyHand_01	An unfortunate result of my actions.

VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_Intro_01	You there! Young... adventurer! I need your help!
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_IntroChu_01	Ah! You! Brave pandaren warrior! Assist me!
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_IntroVessina_01	Noble sethrak shaman, lend me your aid!
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_IntroEudora_01	Excuse me, miss cosplaying vulpera. We could use your help!
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_IntroGeorge_01	Ah, good champion of the Light, Dalaran needs you!
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_IntroOlBarkeye_01	Are we allied with the gnolls these days? No matter. Come!
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_IntroSqueamlish_01	Ahhh, young druid of the... rat! I require your assistance.
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_IntroTekahn_01	A Tol'Vir? Here? Perhaps you could help!
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_IntroRakanishu_01	Uh, sentient flame creature! We could use all the help we can get!
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_IntroKriziki_01	Mmm, wise arakkoa. We could use your guidance!
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_EmoteResponse_01	We can exchange stories after your quest is done.
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_DefeatPlayer_01	Questing's a dangerous business. Any other takers?
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_Idle_01	I'm so lucky I found an adventurer like you wandering about!
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_Idle_02	Dalaran has a lot of problems, big and small. I'll take all the help I can get.
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_Idle_03	I'd do this all myself but I'm more of the delegating type.
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_TurnOne_01	There's a bunch of thieves running around. We need to prepare.
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_TurnOne_02	The city is never short on problems. Thanks for helping out!
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_QuestA_01	The alchemists could use some bear livers. See what you can do.
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_QuestA_02	That's it! Just a few more to go.
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_QuestA_03	Turns out there weren't any livers in them. Curious...
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_QuestB_01	Murlocs have overrun the sewers! That's a no swim zone.
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_QuestB_02	This explains the fishy smell. I just figured you didn't bathe.
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_QuestB_03	Thanks for taking care of that. Here's your rewards.
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_QuestC_01	Try to escort this turtle. Should take about, 5 turns.
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_QuestC_02	Careful now! If he gets eaten it's all over!
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_QuestCFail_01	Poor little one. The cycle of life can be so cruel.
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_QuestC_03	A turtle has made it to the water! Fantastic work!
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_QuestD_01	The herbalists could use your aid picking some delicate flowers.
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_QuestD_02	They'd make for a beautiful bouquet. Just watch your fingers.
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_QuestD_03	Every rose has it's thorn, but these ones have giant fangs.
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_QuestD_04	Not everyone is brave enough to be an Herbalist like you.
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_QuestE_01	Hogger has made his way to Dalaran! He's a wanted gnoll!
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_QuestE_02	Take out his little... Gnollings! They're protecting him!
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_QuestE_03	Fine work for an adventurer.
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_Outro_01	Thanks for helping out! Why don't choose a reward?
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_Outro_02	The city really splurged on these rewards! Pick your favorite.
VO_DALA_BOSS_75h_Male_Human_Death_01	Why...?

VO_Rakanishu_Male_Elemental_FF_Start_02	Anyone seen Ragnaros? Am I... TOO SOON!?

VO_BRMA16_1_CARD_04	You cannot hide!
VO_Nefarian_Male_Dragon_BRM-T1End_01	You brought the city of Dalaran to ME? *laughs*
VO_Omnotron_Male_Mech_BRM-T1End_01	Intruding city detected. Defenses activated.
VO_Ragnaros_Male_Elemental_BRM-T1End_01	SUFFER TRESPASSER!
VO_EVILBRM_DrBoom_01	I'm suitin' up!
VO_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_BRM_Start_01	How did we crash into A MOUNTAIN!? Seriously?
VO_DrBoom_Male_Goblin_BRM_T1End_01	Hey! Runnin' into a mountain isn't an art, it's a SCIENCE!
VO_DrBoom_Male_Goblin_BRM_Victory_01	Now to redocorate this place as my secret lair!
VO_Hagatha_Female_Orc_BRM_Victory_01	You might be evil but WE ARE LEGION!
VO_MadameLazul_Female_Troll_BRM_Victory_01	Everything happens for a reason. Even if it's an odd one.
VO_Togwaggle_Male_Kobold_BRM_Victory_01	Silly mountain is more like molehill!
VO_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_HM_Victory_01	Promising! Very promising!

VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_EliseIntro_01	You! What are you doing skulking around here?
VO_ULDA_BOSS_10h_Male_Sethrak_EliseIntroResponse1_01	No businessss of yoursssss.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_FinleyIntro_01	Finley should be here somewhere?
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_PostFinleyDiscovery1_01	I'd heard there was something marvelous buried here...
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_PostFinleyDiscovery2_01	Didn't realize it might be "me!"
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_FinleyReaction1_01	Ohhh fish!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_BrannIntro_01	Brann? Why are you fighting those creatures?
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_BrannIntroResponse1_01	I'm not fighting 'em! I'm TAMING 'em!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_BrannReaction3_01	Awww what a wee lad!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_BrannTurn1_01	I suppose I'm part of this now...
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_RenoIntro_01	Go away! I'm in the middle of practicing!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_RenoIntroResponse1_01	But we need you to save the world!
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_RenoIntroResponse3_01	Laaater!!
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_RenoReaction1_01	HA! Uh... oops?
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_RenoReaction2_01	Look at that! Ha, I'm basically Medivh!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_RenoReaction2Response1_01	You are basically NOTHING like Medivh...
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_RenoReaction3_01	Wasn't supposed to do that, buuut I did.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_RenoReaction3Response1_01	*exasperated sigh*
VO_ULDA_BOSS_67h_Male_Plague_Lord_TekahnIntro_01	Our plan has been set into motion. It cannot be undone!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_TekahnIntroResponse1_01	We will see about that!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_EliseVictory_01	Tell me the truth!
VO_ULDA_BOSS_10h_Male_Sethrak_EliseVictoryResponse1_01	The League of E.V.I.L. will CRUSSSH you!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_EliseVictoryResponse2_02	The League of "what"?
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_FinleyVictory_01	I am in your debt! But why did you seek me out?
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_FinleyVictoryResponse_01	Evildoers have stolen the city of Dalaran. They're moving into Uldum!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_BRB_01	I shall return!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_BrannVictory_01	Thank ye! This one's learned his manners!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_BrannVictoryResponse1_01	Then he can help us against our new enemies!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_RenoVictory_01	I have an idea, practice against the League of E.V.I.L.
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_RenoVictoryResponse1_01	Ooo YES... who are they again?
VO_ULDA_BOSS_67h_Male_Plague_Lord_TekahnVictory_01	ENOUGH! I shall be in Uldum if you dare to find me!

TB_LEAGUE_REVIVAL_Teraviss_Start	I could ussse one of thessse
TB_LEAGUE_REVIVAL_Teraviss_DefeatTaunt	E.V.I.L. will reward me handsssomely!
TB_LEAGUE_REVIVAL_Finley_DefeatTaunt	FORSOOTH!
TB_LEAGUE_REVIVAL_Brann_Start	I salute ya!
TB_LEAGUE_REVIVAL_Brann_DefeatTaunt	It was in... my grasp.
TB_LEAGUE_REVIVAL_Reno_Start	Hey! Look what I found!
TB_LEAGUE_REVIVAL_Reno_DefeatTaunt	Nobody saw that... I hope?
TB_LEAGUE_REVIVAL_Tekahn_Start	Call forth my army!
TB_LEAGUE_REVIVAL_Tekahn_DefeatTaunt	None defy me!

VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_HostLine1_01	A dark conspirator has crossed my path. Something is afoot.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_HostLine2_01	Help me find the other explorers, they are ever so hard to keep track of!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_HostLine4_01	The fate of the world depends on us!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_EliseReaction3_02	I need help... It's time to round up the League of Explorers!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_HostLine5_01	The League of Explorers has returned! But, we have attracted some attention...
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night_Elf_TekahnVictoryResponse1_01	A great journey lies ahead of us explorers!

VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_SplashScreen_01	Fire, Madness… Murlocs! Rafaam has unleashed the Plagues of Uldum, and only we can stop him. Explorers, to me!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_MapPage_01	I’ve collated eyewitness reports to triangulate the origin of the plagues. We’ll tackle each one at its source.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Chapter1_01	A plague of murlocs are pouring forth from this ruined city. We need to get to the bottom of this.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Chapter2_01	Everyone who ventures across this desert has gone mad. I think it might be the source of the second plague!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Chapter3_01_01	Khartut’s Tomb! According to my research, it’s filled with -
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_TUT_Chapter3_02_01	Treasure!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Chapter3_03_01	Death, Reno. It houses the plague of death! We have to be careful.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Chapter4_01	The Halls of Origination are the very epicenter of all the plagues.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Chapter5_01	The final Plague Lord is Rafaam’s right-hand henchman: Tekahn! Our only chance to defeat him is to work together.
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_TUT_RewardsPage_01	Look! Stuff! I want stuff.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_TUT_Chapter_2_Unlock_01	Let’s head out to the desert, then!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night Elf_TUT_Chapter_3_Unlock_01	We're ready to take on the Tomb now. Let's go!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_TUT_Chapter_4_Unlock_01	Halls of Origination, then. I know that place well!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_Night Elf_TUT_Chapter_5_Unlock_01	The Plaguelords are defeated... for now. It's time to stop Tekahn himself!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_HeroSelect_01	We’ve all trained for this. The four of us are more powerful – and flexible – than ever before.
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_TUT_Reno_StartTreasure_01	Sir Finley, hand me my whip!\n This is my chance to stock up on treasures.
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_TUT_Reno_HeroPower_01	With a little practice I’ll be able to surprise them with some sweet new moves.
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_TUT_Reno_StartingDeck_01	Time to choose my starting equipment. I'll scavenge more gear in the desert.
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_TUT_Reno_FirstBossDrawn_01	Ah! Bad guys! We’ll have to fight our way through, one nasty at a time.
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_TUT_Reno_SecondBossDrawn_01	Is it just me or are these guys getting tougher the farther we go?
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_TUT_Reno_PickTreasure_01	Victory is mine! And so is this sweet, sweet loot. What should I take…?
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_TUT_Reno_PickLoot_01	I’ve been learning a few new tricks. Magic tricks.
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_TUT_Reno_Tavern_01	Ah-hah! A little inn! I can recruit some help here.
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_TUT_Reno_Loss_NonPlague_01	Run. RUN! Drop everything and run for it! We’ll have to start all over again.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_TUT_Finley_StartTreasure_01	I’m off then! Perhaps I shall build up my trophy collection while out and about?
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_TUT_Finley_HeroPower_01	One must never underestimate a murloc armed with… panache.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_TUT_Finley_StartingDeck_01	I shall vary my tactics as I learn more about our foes.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_TUT_Finley_FirstBossDrawn_01	Right, then. We shall fight our way to those dastardly Plague Lords!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_TUT_Finley_SecondBossDrawn_01	Are these foes getting stronger? Hmmm. Quite.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_TUT_Finley_PickTreasure_01	Oh I say, adventuring can be quite lucrative.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_TUT_Finley_PickLoot_01	Now, to flesh out my strategy! Paladin by trade, shaman by nature.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_TUT_Finley_Tavern_01	How delightful! A friendly place to mingle and adjust my minions.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_TUT_Finley_Loss_NonPlague_01	Oh bother! I shall have to begin again.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Elise_StartTreasure_01	There are artifacts in Uldum that can aid us in our quest. But we must find them!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Elise_HeroPower_01	A true explorer never stops training. There are skills I have yet to learn!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Elise_StartingDeck_01	Success begins with preparation. Where shall I start?
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Elise_FirstBossDrawn_01	My quest begins here! With each victory, I expect to face more difficult foes.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Elise_SecondBossDrawn_01	Our enemies grow stronger. But I'm getting more powerful, as well.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Elise_PickTreasure_01	Uldum is rich with treasures, but I’ll need to be smart to take advantage of them.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Elise_PickLoot_01	Time to gear up for my next encounter. Should I focus on my druidic skills or priestly magic…?
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Elise_Tavern_01	I need to put my weapons away here. But this is a great opportunity.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Elise_Loss_NonPlague_01	I was outplayed that time… but I learned a thing or two for my next attempt.
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_TUT_Brann_StartTreasure_01	Uldum is filled with ancient wonders… We ought to grab a few while we’re here.
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_TUT_Brann_HeroPower_01	I’m not scared o’ field work. I might learn a new trick or two.
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_TUT_Brann_StartingDeck_01	What should I focus on? I’m a skilled hunter but also quite the warrior.
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_TUT_Brann_FirstBossDrawn_01	Let’s smash some bad guys!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_TUT_Brann_SecondBossDrawn_01	The baddies will put up more of a fight as we delve deeper into Uldum.
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_TUT_Brann_PickTreasure_01	Treasure! There’s always room in me pack fer a little extra help…
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_TUT_Brann_PickLoot_01	Hunter traps… warrior tricks… DINOSAURS! Hah hah, they won’t know what hit ‘em.
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_TUT_Brann_Tavern_01	This place isn't fer fightin'. But I can recruit some help!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_TUT_Brann_Loss_NonPlague_01	Oh, that smarts! Well, back at it. We’ll start all over again.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_PlagueLord_First_Drawn_01	There – that’s a Plague Lord! One of the sources of all this horror!
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_TUT_PlagueLord_Turn1_Reno_01	Elise! This thing’s a GIANT! How can we hope to defeat it?
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_TUT_PlagueLord_Turn1_Finley_01	E-GADS! Look at the size of that thing! How can we beat this?
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_TUT_PlagueLord_Turn1_Brann_01	Great Grim Guzzler! That thing is HUGE! Elise! Halp!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_PlagueLord_Turn1_Elise_01	This thing is bigger than I thought!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_PlagueLord_Turn1_EliseAnswer_01	Stay focused. It can’t regenerate – do what damage you can, and we will finish it off later!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_PlagueLord_Turn1_EliseAnswerSelf_01	I will not defeat it in one battle… but I can weaken it!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_PlagueLord_First_Defeat_01	Everyone, regroup! If we damage the Plague Lord a little every time, we will eventually triumph.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_PlagueLord_First_Win_01	We did it! One Plague Lord is destroyed… but others remain.
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_TUT_PlagueLord_Second_Win_01	Another Plague Lord down! We just might save the world yet.
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_TUT_PlagueLord_Third_Win_01	Three Plague Lords have fallen! But it’s not over yet.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_PlagueLord_Fourth_Win_01	Great work! Now we finish this…
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Finale_BossCardDrawn_01	Dark Pharoah Tekahn is resurrecting the Plague Lords – we have to move fast!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Finale_CharacterSelect_01	All four of us must work together, using the decks we’ve built on our adventures.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Finale_FirstDefeat_01	We can’t give up! As long as one of us is still standing, we can keep fighting!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Finale_Final_Defeat_01	Explorers… regroup! We are beaten this day, but maybe we can return when we are stronger…
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_TUT_Finale_VICTORY_01_01	We did it! We saved the world! We’re THAT good!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Finale_VICTORY_02_01	What did Tekahn mean about the “Final Plague"?
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_TUT_Finale_VICTORY_03_01	And where did Rafaam run off to? Dalaran is gone!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_TUT_Finale_VICTORY_04_01	Indeed, my friends. I hazard that this ordeal is not… quite… over.
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_TUT_Finale_Reno_Treasures_01	My treasures! I'm glad I collected these.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_TUT_Finale_Finley_Treasures_01	Ah, the treasures I've collected. Very good.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_TUT_Finale_Elise_Treasures_01	The treasures I've collected should help.
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_TUT_Finale_Brann_Treasures_01	Ah-hah! There's the artifacts I collected earlier.
	
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_STORY_Banter_Reno_Chapter01a_01	This city was missing for generations… imagine the loot!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_STORY_Banter_Reno_Chapter01b_01	Keep it together, Reno! We’re here for a reason.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_STORY_Banter_Finley_Chapter01a_01	This plague chap we’re hunting… He’s a murloc yes?
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_STORY_Banter_Finley_Chapter01b_01	Don’t try ta negotiate wit’ it, Finley! Tea time’s over!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_STORY_Banter_Brann_Chapter01a_01	This city's a ruin! What does E.V.I.L. want here?
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_STORY_Banter_Brann_Chapter01b_01	The ancient Tol’vir had maps to every Titan artifact in the region.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_STORY_Banter_Elise_Chapter01a_01	This murloc plague will destroy the world!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_STORY_Banter_Elise_Chapter01b_01	I shall endeavor not to take offense.
	
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_STORY_Banter_Reno_Chapter02a_01	This desert stretches on forever…
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_STORY_Banter_Reno_Chapter02b_01	Keep going, Reno. Somewhere beyond these dunes lies Khartut's Tomb.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_STORY_Banter_Finley_Chapter02a_01	Water… Oh! I shall go mad with thirst!
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_STORY_Banter_Finley_Chapter02b_01	Hang in there little buddy! Don't go mad... until we find the Plague Lord of madness!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_STORY_Banter_Brann_Chapter02a_01	The desert… keeps twistin' around on itself!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_STORY_Banter_Brann_Chapter02b_01	That’s the Plague of Madness. It’s twisting our perceptions.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_STORY_Banter_Elise_Chapter02a_01	The madness is here… none of my maps make any sense…
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_STORY_Banter_Elise_Chapter02b_01	Put the maps away fer once an’ go wit’ yer gut, Elise!
	
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_STORY_Banter_Reno_Chapter03a_01	Tomb raiding can be dangerous. Good thing I got my lucky murloc foot.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_STORY_Banter_Reno_Chapter03b_01	Your lucky… what!?
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_STORY_Banter_Finley_Chapter03a_01	A-hem. So we’re hunting a plague of… death? Is it?
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_STORY_Banter_Finley_Chapter03b_01	Oh aye. Ancient tombs, a plague of death – this is real wrath o’ the Titans stuff!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_STORY_Banter_Brann_Chapter03a_01	This place gave me the willies before it were haunted by death.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_STORY_Banter_Brann_Chapter03b_01	The Plague Lord of death is no different than the others. We will find a way to beat it.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_STORY_Banter_Elise_Chapter03a_01	Any secrets this tomb holds are being destroyed by E.V.I.L. thugs!
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_STORY_Banter_Elise_Chapter03b_01	Elise, there is a time for careful study. And a time to punch faces. It’s face-punching time.
	
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_STORY_Banter_Reno_Chapter04a_01	Look at all these ancient Titan doodads!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_STORY_Banter_Reno_Chapter04b_01	Reno, don’t run around randomly flipping switches and opening doors! That’s Brann’s job.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_STORY_Banter_Finley_Chapter04a_01	Titan Keepers who shaped Azeroth once walked these halls!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_STORY_Banter_Finley_Chapter04b_01	Aye. And there are devices in here that can re-shape Azeroth… fer the worse!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_STORY_Banter_Brann_Chapter04a_01	I cannae believe this place is bein’ used fer E.V.I.L.!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_STORY_Banter_Brann_Chapter04b_01	It is fitting that Rafaam would choose a plague of wrath to strike at us.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_STORY_Banter_Elise_Chapter04a_01	These halls… so ancient… so complex!
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_STORY_Banter_Elise_Chapter04b_01	Yes yes, you and Brann can come back and study this place after we save the world!
	
VO_ULDA_BOSS_67h_Male_PlagueLord_STORY_Finale_Elise_vs_Tekahn_b_01	You have witnessed the power of … the Final Plague.

VO_ULDA_BOSS_67h_Male_PlagueLord_STORY_Finale_FinalPhase_a_01	This is not what was to be… Rafaam! What about our deal!?
VO_DALA_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_STORY_Finale_FinalPhase_b_01	The deal stands. Unleash the plagues, and Uldum is yours… if you can keep it!
VO_DALA_Rafaam_Male_Ethereal_STORY_Finale_FinalPhase_c_01	I’ve got what I needed. Good luck with those explorers.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_67h_Male_PlagueLord_STORY_Finale_FinalPhase_d_01	Rafaam!!
	
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_STORY_Reno_Goes_Mad_01	Oh no… I think the madness has taken hold of Reno…


VO_ULDA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Intro_01	I got something special to deal with you.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_IntroFinley_01	I thought the murlocs were on our side!
VO_ULDA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_EmoteResponse_01	Keep on yapping...
VO_ULDA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_DefeatPlayer_01	Time for a name change: League of Losers!
VO_ULDA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_HeroPower_01	How 'bout some BOOMshot?
VO_ULDA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_HeroPower_02	Direct hit!
VO_ULDA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_HeroPower_04	Oh yeah! Keep lining up for me!
VO_ULDA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_HeroPower_05	This's why they pay me the big bucks!
VO_ULDA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Idle_01	At least E.V.I.L..'s got good dental…
VO_ULDA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Idle_02	Do these clowns really think they can stop us?
VO_ULDA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Idle_03	Jokes on you, I don't even KNOW the secret plan…
VO_ULDA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_PlayerGatlingWand_01	Hey! That's not standard issue! Where'd you get it?!
VO_ULDA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_PlayerGoblinBomb_01	Those ain't yours! Knock it off!
VO_ULDA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_PlayerBlunderbuss_01	Brought a gun to a gun fight, then?
VO_ULDA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_BossLackey_01	Get out there and do some evil!
VO_ULDA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_BossPressurePlate_01	Ooh watch your step, hahaha.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_BossTriggerRapidFire_01	This thing shoots fast, too!
VO_ULDA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_BossMarkedShot_01	Right between the eyes…

VO_ULDA_BOSS_33h_Male_Gnome_Idle_01	This is the LAST time I pilot one of these.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_33h_Male_Gnome_Idle_02	Go to the desert they said, pilot a giant machine, it'll be fine!
VO_ULDA_BOSS_33h_Male_Gnome_Idle_03	Plagues running rampant. Mechs out of control. What a week.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_33h_Male_Gnome_PlayerEMPOperative_01	Hey! You with the E.M.P.! You missed the diver!

VO_ULDA_BOSS_72h_Male_TitanConstruct_DeathALT_01	Harness... your... hatred.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_72h_Male_TitanConstruct_DefeatPlayer_01	You fear that which you cannot control. But can you control your fear?

VO_ULDA_BOSS_73h_Male_NefersetTolvir_Idle_01	You should have turned back when you could.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_73h_Male_NefersetTolvir_Idle_02	Beg forgiveness and the Dark Pharaoh may yet spare you.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_73h_Male_NefersetTolvir_Idle_03	Our power has grown. The plagues are but a prelude.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_73h_Male_NefersetTolvir_PlayerTrigger_Siamat_01	Return to your prison!

VO_ULDA_BOSS_74h_Male_NefersetTolvir_Idle_03	The winds bend beneath my wings.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_74h_Male_NefersetTolvir_PlayerTrigger_High_Priest_Amet_01	Your tribe was always inferior, Amet.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_74h_Male_NefersetTolvir_PlayerTrigger_Mogu_Cultist_01	You toy with unimaginable power.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_74h_Male_NefersetTolvir_PlayerTrigger_Living_Monument_01	Our history should not be used against us!

VO_ULDA_BOSS_74h_Male_NefersetTolvir_BossTriggerDesperateMeasures_01	These are desperate times.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_74h_Male_NefersetTolvir_BossTriggerPenance_01	Your insolence has cost you!

VO_ULDA_BOSS_75h_Male_NefersetTolvir_Intro_01	Stay quiet. I'm hunting something.

VO_ULDA_BOSS_75h_Male_NefersetTolvir_DefeatPlayer_01	Another successful hunt.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_75h_Male_NefersetTolvir_HeroPower_02	Every creature has vulnerabilities.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_75h_Male_NefersetTolvir_HeroPower_03	What doesn't kill it makes me stronger.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_75h_Male_NefersetTolvir_HeroPower_04	A test between predator and prey...
VO_ULDA_BOSS_75h_Male_NefersetTolvir_HeroPower_05	What will this reveal?
VO_ULDA_BOSS_75h_Male_NefersetTolvir_Idle_01	I hunt the most dangerous game. Also: murlocs.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_75h_Male_NefersetTolvir_Idle_02	Usually I hunt beasts, but I am open-minded.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_75h_Male_NefersetTolvir_Idle_03	I talk to myself a lot. Talking to the prey is just weird.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_75h_Male_NefersetTolvir_PlayerTrigger_Desert_Hare_01	Hah, not challenging enough.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_75h_Male_NefersetTolvir_PlayerTrigger_Oasis_Surger_01	My greatest fear... water!

VO_ULDA_BOSS_76h_Male_NefersetTolvir_IntroFinley_01	A noble warrior! This will be a duel for the ages.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_76h_Male_NefersetTolvir_IntroReno_01	You meddle with powers you cannot comprehend.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_76h_Male_NefersetTolvir_IntroBrann_01	I am a champion of the Tolvir. Show me your best, dwarf.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_76h_Male_NefersetTolvir_IntroEliseFirst_01	You who command life itself: You are a worthy foe.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_76h_Male_NefersetTolvir_EmoteResponse_01	I will not negotiate. I serve only Tekahn.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_76h_Male_NefersetTolvir_DefeatPlayer_01	Now to see to the fate of my tribe...
VO_ULDA_BOSS_76h_Male_NefersetTolvir_HeroPower_01	Expect the unexpected.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_76h_Male_NefersetTolvir_HeroPower_02	Cutting down the competition.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_76h_Male_NefersetTolvir_HeroPower_03	Strengths can be weaknesses.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_76h_Male_NefersetTolvir_HeroPower_05	I fight fair, in my own way.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_76h_Male_NefersetTolvir_Idle_01	My people turned to darkness.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_76h_Male_NefersetTolvir_Idle_02	Though my body is stone, my heart is not.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_76h_Male_NefersetTolvir_Idle_03	Outsiders will only worsen our plight.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_76h_Male_NefersetTolvir_PlayerTrigger_Phalanx_Commander_01	We are not so different, are we?

VO_ULDA_BOSS_76h_Male_NefersetTolvir_PlayerTriggerBrawl_01	There is no honor in this barbaric display.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_76h_Male_NefersetTolvir_BossTriggerSubdue_01	This one does not deserve the power it wields!
VO_ULDA_BOSS_76h_Male_NefersetTolvir_BossTriggerTruesilverChampion_01	This noble blade suits me fine.
VO_ULDA_BOSS_76h_Male_NefersetTolvir_BossTriggerAttackPlayerFace_01	Have at thee, feeble one!

VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_Plague_Murloc_01	This… being… is comprised of murlocs… don't let Finley get too close!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_Plague_Wrath_01	History proves that pointless wrath leads to a swift downfall.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_Plague_Death_01	The League of Explorers has faced death before - I do not fear you!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_Plague_Madness_01	I feel… confused. This creature is warping our minds!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_Plague_Fire_01	The League is ready for you, Tekahn. Your plagues will come to an end!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_VeraRidley_01	You would waste your talents on petty crime?
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_Teraviss_01	You have a lot of nerve, pestering me again!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_StartResponse_vs_Ichabod_01	Please… don't… touch me.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_StartResponse_vs_Illidara_01	Journal Entry #542: Reliquary presence in Uldum. Motives unclear.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_Ermavar_01	Where is your so-called Pharoah, Tekahn?!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_Twizzleflux_01	Journal Entry #395: E.V.I.L. appears to have hired local… riff-raff.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_Edra_01	Dryad! We come in the service of life as well!
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_Dovo_01	Oh... Fastfuse. Brann warned me about you.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_StartResponse_vs_EarthragerPtah_01	Journey Entry #634: Enormous bone wraith discovered. Curious.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_Kasa_01	She seems to be affected by the Plague of Madness…
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_StartResponse_vs_Kasmut_01	I come equipped with more than just knowledge.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_Sand_Puffer_Frog_01	This is the cutest thing that has tried to kill me thus far.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_Taskmaster_Maru_01	Journey Entry #181: E.V.I.L.'s recruitment efforts appear to be orchestrated by a vulpera.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_Jythiros_01	I've been preparing my entire life to challenge one such as you.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_Zaraam_01	Journal Entry: #928: Discovered an Ethereal,  completely corrupted…
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_StartResponse_vs_Tarkus_01	You will regret that assumption soon.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_StartResponse_vs_Vessina_01	It'll take a lot more than a meager assassin.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_StartResponse_vs_Avozu_01	What?
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_EliseTreasureAddarah_01	The League appreciates your assistance with this, Addarah.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_EliseTreasureAddarah_02	It's great to have an expert with us, Addarah.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_EliseTreasureDruidStaff_01	Hm. Druidic magic really suits me.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_EliseTreasureMap_01	Unlike Reno, I don't go "where the wind takes me". I go where the map leads.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_EliseTreasureTabletoftheTitans_01	The Titans harnessed so much power in such a small object…
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_EliseTreasureMachete_01	There isn't as much jungle to cut through, but it has its uses.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_EliseTreasureScarabStatue_01	We grabbed this one for educational purposes, contrary to what Reno thinks.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_EliseJrExplorer_01	You're doing a great job, explorer.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_MACDiver_01	We should probably get out of the way…
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_Oasis_01	Something is not right here…
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_TrapRoom_01	I have the blueprint for this room here somewhere…
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Start_vs_Sinkhole_01	Uldum's natural threats are almost as dangerous as the supernatural ones.
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Entering_The_Inn_01	Who in the world would run an inn in the middle of this place?
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Entering_The_Inn_02	I might be able to recruit some help here…
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Entering_The_Inn_03	I smell food… and hear… laughter? What IS this place?
VO_ULDA_Elise_Female_NightElf_Defeat_Plague_Lord_Finale_01	This one has been defeated. I'm ready to take on Tekahn.
	
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_TRIGGER_KillCommand_01	Sic 'em!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_TRIGGER_Whirlwind_01	Yer startin' ta tick me off!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_TRIGGER_SecretTrap_01	Ah've got ya now!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_EVIL_01	One of Rafaam's goons!? C'mere an' get what's comin' to ye!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_Plague_Murloc_01	A plague of murlocs… insidious!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_Plague_Wrath_01	Back under the ground with ye, Plague Lord.
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_Plague_Death_01	So yer the Plague Lord of Death? Not. Impressed.
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_Plague_Madness_01	Madness! MADNESS! No, no - stay focused, Brann.
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_Plague_Fire_01	Yer first, Tekahn. Then we're comin' after yer boss!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_Colossus_of_the_Sun_01	We don't have ta fight. Some of me closest relatives are made o' mineral!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_StartResponse_vs_Zafarr_01	And now I'll be endin' it!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_Mister_Chu_01	You're in my way!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_Battrund_01	Wakey, wakey!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_StartResponse_vs_Twizzleflux_01	I'll show you my own kinda cursin'!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_Sothis_01	A Titan Watcher! They've unleashed all of the security measures, then…
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_Illidara_01	Ah've got no time for Reliquary shenanigans right now.
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_Thud_01	A mechagnome. Ya gotta appreciate the Titan engineering on that!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_Sazin_01	Yer just a load of hot air!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_Pillager_Drasar_01	Ah can't believe that you're just… robbing the titans!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_OlBarkeye_01	A gnoll is with E.V.I.L.? Two of me least favorite things, workin' together!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_StartResponse_vs_Jythiros_01	I ain't afraid of some silly questions!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_Construct_01	These constructs… they're the Guardians of the Halls! Be careful!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_StartResponse_vs_Avozu_01	What?
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_BrannTreasureTitanHologramDisk_01	Ye'd be surprised how many problems ancient Titan knowledge tends ta solve.
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_BrannTreasureGiantEgg_01	Ah've got a HUGE egg, ah hope you're ready to meet what's inside!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_BrannTreasureFlo_01	Ya come from a long line of explorers, Flo; I know ye won't disappoint!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_BrannTreasureJrExplorer_01	Ah don't worry, yer gonna do great out there!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_BrannTreasureBlunderbuss_01	My new friend's got a reaaaaal meanstreak! Wanna meet 'em?
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_BrannTreasureSaddle_01	Nothin' more important when ridin' a dino than staying comfortable.
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_Skarik_01	What's a giant snake but a long dinosaur, eh?
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_Wildtooth_01	I need ta tame that sand beast!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_MACDiver_01	Ah don't usually deal with heavy machinery, an' this is why!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_Oasis_01	Fresh water, peaceful scenery… this is a trap if ever I've seen one.
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_TrapRoom_01	Something here isn't quite right…
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Start_vs_Sinkhole_01	Grab a rope, everything's sinkin'!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Entering_The_Inn_01	Oh, what a sight fer sore eyes! A friendly inn!
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Entering_The_Inn_02	What's this? A wee tavern? …here!?
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Entering_The_Inn_03	This is the perfect opportunity to drum up some new recruits.
VO_ULDA_Brann_Male_Dwarf_Defeat_Plague_Lord_Finale_01	Done and dusted! Let's go take on the big baddy!
	
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Trigger_Consecration_01	By the Light, indeed!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Trigger_Tip_the_Scales_01	Thanks for the assist, chums.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Trigger_Bloodlust_01	I'm terribly vexed!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Start_vs_EVIL_01	An agent of E.V.I.L.! I daresay this will get unpleasant.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Start_vs_Plague_Murloc_01	A plague of murlocs? Insufferable! Why not a garden party? 
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Start_vs_Plague_Wrath_01	Wrath? You have not felt wrath until you've earned the ire of… SIR FINLEY!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Start_vs_Plague_Death_01	You seem the unpleasant type. Death, I presume?
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Start_vs_Plague_Madness_01	I shall not succumb to your madness! I do worry about Reno, however.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Start_vs_Plague_Fire_01	You will be destroyed, Tekahn, or my name isn't Sir Finley Mrrgglton!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Misc_01	Gather us together, fine. But there's no need to go plaguing about!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Misc_02	Do not make me move my monocle to the opposite eye in an unambivalent show of aggression!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Misc_03	That will be quite enough finger-pointing.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Start_Response_Vera_Ridley_01	Why thank you for noticing! But I do not actually wear shoes.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Start_Response_Squeamlish_01	And I am Sir Finley, of the Sands!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Start_vs_Scalesnout_01	Put the snake down and your paws in the air, sir!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_StartResponse_vs_Ichabod_01	Oh dear. Do you need a hanky?
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Start_vs_Sazin_01	A creature made entirely of wind! I am intrigued!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_StartResponse_vs_Rhogi_01	Your pernicious sand-flinging is no help!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_StartResponse_vs_Jythiros_01	Oh, I do love a game such as this!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_StartResponse_vs_Avozu_01	What?
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Start_vs_LtHerring_01	What are those parachutes?! Preposterous!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Start_vs_Wildtooth_01	Oh my, that sand has quite fouled your breath.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Start_vs_WaterTotingMurlocs_01	Pardon me. I have questions. About the water.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Start_vs_Octosari_01	How do you stay hydrated out here?
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_FinleyTreasureScarabMount_01	My faithful steed! We ride into battle!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_FinleyTreasurePandarenTeaSet_01	A fine tea set. For the gentlemen-adventurer.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_FinleyTreasureMurkyHorn_01	To battle, my be-scaled allies!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_FinleyTreasureKarl_01	Glad to have you by our side, noble knight!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_FinleyTreasureJrExplorer_01	Even I was but a squire once!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_FinleyTreasureLance_01	A noble knight needs a brilliant weapon, after all.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Start_vs_MACDiver_01	Oh dear. I'd rather not end up a knight sandwich.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Start_vs_Oasis_01	My gills are tingling. Something is not quite right…
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Start_vs_TrapRoom_01	This room is positively dangerous. I just know it.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Start_vs_Sinkhole_01	"Sir Finley of the Sands" was not to be taken literally!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Entering_The_Inn_01	Enough fighting. Time for a spot of tea with friends.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Entering_The_Inn_02	I say, that's a… pop-up… tavern? Right!
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Entering_The_Inn_03	How delightful! I shall endeavor to "network" as they say.
VO_ULDA_Finley_Male_Murloc_Defeat_Plague_Lord_Finale_01	I am triumphant. Let us press forward to Tekahn!

VO_HeadlessHorseman_Male_Human_HHIntro_02	The flames have risen and the weak have fled, now mummies take over in my stead.
VO_HeadlessHorseman_Male_Human_HHReaction1_01	He brings the night that has no dawn, cower in terror of Dark Pharoah Tekahn!
VO_HeadlessHorseman_Male_Human_Misc_01	<_Terrifying Laughter_>

VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_NewModeLaunch_01	The Battlegrounds are here! I think you can win the whole thing, my friend.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_NewModeLaunchalt_01	The Battlegrounds are open!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_ModeSelect_01	Welcome to the Battlegrounds! Eight combatants enter, only one will take the crown.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_HeroSelection_01	Your minions will do the fighting, but they need a strong commander.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_ShopFirstTime_01	Here you can recruit new minions for the battle. Choose well!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_FirstBattle_01	Time to battle! Your minions will attack on their own, left-to-right.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_BattleEndFirstLoss_01	Well, you didn’t win that one, but don’t worry – you can recruit more minions!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_ShopUpgrade_01	You can upgrade the tavern to get access to more powerful minions.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_FirstDefeat_01	Don’t take it too hard. There are eight players but only one winner. Try again!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_FirstVictory_01	That’s how it’s done! You’re a real inspiration, friend!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_UpgradeShop_01	You might want to upgrade the tavern here. Otherwise you’ll fall behind your opponents!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_AFK_01	You’ll get a slow start with this hero, but then you’ll be ahead of the crowd.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_NewGame_01	What’s your strategy this time, partner?
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_NewGame_02	Seven fresh opponents. Are you ready?
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_NewGame_03	My favorite commander is back! Ready to get started?
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_General_01	Welcome back! How’s it going out there?
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_General_02	I’ve got some fresh recruits for you!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_General_03	The battle is really raging out there!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_CombatWin_01	Your minions really pulled their weight!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_CombatWin_02	You’re good at this!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_CombatWin_03	Nice work out there! Keep up the pressure.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_CombatLoss_01	It’s okay, we all hit some bumps now and then.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_CombatLoss_02	Rough battle? Pick yourself back up and turn it around!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_CombatLoss_03	Any defeat that doesn’t destroy you makes you stronger!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_ShopToCombat_01	Have a good battle, friend!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_ShopToCombat_02	Don’t tell the others – I’m rooting for you.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Behind_01	You can still make a comeback!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Behind_02	You are not out of this yet!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Behind_03	You can turn this around!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Ahead_01	You’re doing great out there!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Ahead_02	Keep up the momentum, friend!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Ahead_03a	I think you can win this thing.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_FirstPlace_01	Everyone’s gunning for you. Watch out!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_FirstPlace_02	You’ve got this. You’re way ahead!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_FirstPlace_03	Let’s see if you can stay on top!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_AfterShopUpgrade_01	Great! Let’s get some better minions in here.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_AfterShopUpgrade_02	Yeah, let’s step up our game! 
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_AfterShopUpgrade_03	Great! I can bring in more powerful minions now.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_AfterShopUpgrade_04	Now we are in business!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Idle_01	Some tough choices here.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Idle_02	Spend wisely. But you know… spend!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Idle_03	It’s a joy to watch you work.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Idle_04	I like how your strategy is shaking out.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Idle_05	I like how you’re handling this one.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_RecruitSmallMinion_01	It’s not the strongest, but it’ll fight hard.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_RecruitSmallMinion_02	It’s good to get some minions in play.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_RecruitSmallMinion_03b	That one might make all the difference. 
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_RecruitMediumMinion_01	That’s what I would’ve picked.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_RecruitMediumMinion_02	A good, tactical choice.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_RecruitMediumMinion_03	I like where you’re going with this.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_RecruitLargeMinion_01	That’ll do some damage!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_RecruitLargeMinion_02	That’s quite the army you’re building, friend!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_RecruitLargeMinion_03	Go big or go home, I always say.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_AfterTriple_01	Oh ho! You’re moving up in the world!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_AfterTriple_02	Exactly what you were looking for.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_AfterTriple_03	That’s a great play. I can’t wait to see this shake out.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Triple_03	A triple! Here’s your reward. 
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Flavor_01	I’ve been freelancing since they trashed my place in Dalaran.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Flavor_02	Have you ever met the League of Explorers? Nice folk. Great hats.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Flavor_03	I’ve dealt with the League of EVIL. Terrible people. But good tippers!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Flavor_04	I once served a drink to a Death Knight. It froze over… right in his hands!
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Flavor_05	You know, I think you could win this whole thing.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Flavor_06	How do I attract all these minions? Two words: Funnel. Cakes. 
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Flavor_07	Sorry about the peanut shells on the floor. These minions are slobs.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Flavor_08	All the best minions come here. I’ve got the spicy pretzel mustard. 
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_AfterSelling_01	You're down a minion and up a gold.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_AfterSelling_02	I didn't like that one either. Here's a gold for the trouble.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_AfterFreezing_01	I’ll make sure these ones stick around for next time.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_AfterFreezing_02a	I’ll save these ones for later.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Hire_01	Go ahead and hire one of these recruits.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Hire_02	Better hire a recruit while you can.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Triple_01	Hiring that minion will get you a triple.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_Triple_02	Looks like you can get a triple.
VO_DALA_BOSS_99h_Male_Human_RecruitWork_01	Now put that recruit to work.

VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss1_Start_01	I left it in here somewhere. Whack away at the mess!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss1_Exchange1Response_01	You could be a little tidier, Reno.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss1_Exchange1Response_01	Who needs cleaning when you have MAGIC?!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_Northrend_Boss1_Exchange2_01	I cannot believe Reno’s got so much trash!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Northrend_Boss1_Exchange2Response_01	I can.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss1_Exchange3Response_01	What if you simply memorized your spells?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss1_Exchange3Response_01	Oh, I should try that!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss1_Loss_01	I’m sure it was in there! Let’s look again.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss1_Victory_01	There you go! A shiny portal to Northrend!
VO_TB_GALAPortals_OrgGuardH_Male_Orc_Northrend_Boss2_Start_01	Stand down, Alliance scum!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Northrend_Boss2_Exchange1_01	This is all a misunderstanding--we took a wrong portal.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_WinterEVIL_Exchange6_01	Time for the season's BEATINGS! *laughs*
VO_DRGA_BOSS_06h_Female_Orc_WinterEVIL_Exchange10_01	Can't I celebrate something else?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_WinterEVIL_Exchange1_01	HO HO HO! Greatfather Rafaam is on the go!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_WinterEVIL_Loss_01	Yes, the holidays can be exhausting... but you can do better than that!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_WinterEVIL_Start_01	Deck the halls with boughs of EVIL! It's Winter Veil everyone!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_WinterEVIL_Start_02	'Twas the night before Winter Veil and with great upheaval...
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_WinterEVIL_Start_03	The villains and their lackeys made the holiday EVIL!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_WinterEVIL_Victory_01	Our preparations are complete! Now remember the greatest gift of all... is the one you steal from an unwitting adventurer!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_WinterEVIL_Exchange4_01	Be giving BEST presents to your king!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_09h_Female_Troll_WinterEVIL_Exchange8_01	Don't shake the presents! I can tell you what they are...
VO_TB_GALAPortals_OrgGuardH_Male_Orc_Northrend_Boss2_Exchange1Response_01	Silence, elf!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss2_Exchange2_01	Take that guard out, and I’ll cast the right spell this time!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss2_Exchange3_01	The portal spell was in cursive! It was hard to read!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss2_Victory_01	Okay, I’ve memorized it—the portal spell to NORTHREND!
VO_TB_GALAPortals_OrgGuardH_Male_Orc_Northrend_Boss2_Loss_01	The Alliance hang out with murlocs now? Disgusting.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss2_StartResponse_01	Well I never!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss3_HostLine_01	Huh. Northrend is warmer than I thought.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Northrend_Boss3_Start_01	Reno, we're in Un’goro Crater!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Northrend_Boss3_Exchange1_01	Aren’t you tired of dinosaurs yet, Brann?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_Northrend_Boss3_Exchange1Response_01	NEVER!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss3_Exchange2_01	Think of this as good practice against all those E.V.I.L. critters.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss3_Victory_01	Reno, do the honors. Properly this time!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss4_HostLine_01	Uh, sorry. I was thinking about being proper.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Northrend_Boss4_HostLineResponse_01	Oh dear.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss4_Start_01	Fear not, I am marvelous at chess!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss4_Exchange1_01	Everything’s magic here! Even the floor is magic!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_Northrend_Boss4_Exchange2_01	Hey, he's cheating. That's not fair!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss4_Exchange2Response_01	We'll have to do our best regardless.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss4_Exchange3_01	If only we'd used the Ravenholdt defense!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss4_Loss_01	Do me the courtesy of a rematch, I beg you!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss4_Victory_01	Checkmate! Reno, take us away!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss4_VictoryResponse_01	You got it.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_Northrend_Boss5_HostLine_01	Ahh! Smells like home!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Northrend_Boss5_HostLineResponse_01	I think you're right!
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_Northrend_Boss5_Start_01	 So, about your overdue fines...
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_Northrend_Boss5_Start_02	It's time to pay up, book hoarders.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss5_Exchange1_01	I say, didn't you used to work in Dalaran?
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_Northrend_Boss5_Exchange1Response_01	SHH. I had to move after the invasion.
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_Northrend_Boss5_Exchange2_01	You four have racked up some serious penalties.
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_Northrend_Boss5_Exchange3_01	Half the books in this library are missing because of you.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss5_Exchange3Response1_01	Half of them are only HERE because of us!
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_Northrend_Boss5_Exchange3Response2_01	SHH!
VO_DALA_BOSS_22h_Female_Pandaren_Northrend_Boss5_Exchange4_01	Maybe you should explore turning in your books on time.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_Northrend_Boss5_Victory_01	I dinnae like this new librarian!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Northrend_Boss5_VictoryResponse_01	Books are important. But saving the world, even more so. Reno, cast the portal!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss6_HostLine_01	Reno, it seems a bit... fiery for the frozen north.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss6_HostLineResponse_01	I’m still working on my technique!
VO_DAL_719_Male_Kobold_Northrend_Boss6_Start_01	Me is being left behind by nasty League! Me is ANGRY!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss6_Exchange1_01	This kobold is really upset. Almost makes you feel bad for him.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_Northrend_Boss6_Exchange1Response_01	Almost.
VO_DAL_719_Male_Kobold_Northrend_Boss6_Exchange2_01	Tak is being lonely, but still EVIL!
VO_DAL_719_Male_Kobold_Northrend_Boss6_Exchange3_01	City flew bye-bye without Tak. Me is missing fast-paced urban lifestyle!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss6_Victory1_01	Fine work. We fought the League of E.V.I.L. on our way to fight... the League of E.V.I.L.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss6_Victory2_01	Reno, a portal, if you please!
VO_DAL_719_Male_Kobold_Northrend_Boss6_Loss_01	ME TAKE... REVENGE!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Northrend_Boss7_HostLine_01	I don’t know where we are, but it isn’t Northrend.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss7_Start_01	Is that... Hagatha? She looks different.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_Northrend_Boss7_StartResponse_01	Something seems fishy.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss7_Exchange1_01	Do you suppose we could reason with her?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Northrend_Boss7_Exchange1Response_01	Have you learned nothing from the plague of murlocs?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss7_Exchange2_01	Was Hagatha a murloc the whole time?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Northrend_Boss7_Exchange2Response_01	Er, no. This is someone else, Reno.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss7_Victory_01	All right, I’ve finally figured this portal thingy out!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss8_HostLine_01	But first, one more detour...
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss8_EnemyScreenLine_01	I’ve always wanted to see the Gurubashi Arena!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss8_Start_01	I believe it is custom here to challenge you to a duel!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Northrend_Boss8_Start_01	You mean... we have to fight each other?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Northrend_Boss8_EliseKillShrine_01	This shrine is not a toy! It has historical significance.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Northrend_Boss8_EliseShrineKilled_01	I’m going to miss that shrine.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Northrend_Boss8_EliseShrineReturns_01	My shrine has returned.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss8_RenoKillShrine_01	Stop being annoying!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss8_RenoShrineKilled_01	Hey, that was MY shrine.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss8_RenoShrineReturns_01	Shrine’s back in business!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_Northrend_Boss8_BrannKillShrine_01	Bad shrine. Time out!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_Northrend_Boss8_BrannShrineKilled_01	Aw, my wee shrine...
VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_Northrend_Boss8_BrannShrineReturns_01	My shrine's all better!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss8_FinleyKillShrine_01	Be gone, foul thing!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss8_FinleyShrineKilled_01	Oh fish sticks, my shrine!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss8_FinleyShrineReturns_01	My shrine is back! Most excellent!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss8_Loss_01	Please accept my heartfelt apologies.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Northrend_Boss8_Loss_01	Aw, Finley... I was a little too hard on you.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss1_EnemyScreenLine_01	I’ll open a portal to take us up north! I just need to find the right scroll.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss2_EnemyScreenLine_01	At least we can still rely upon our battle prowess!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Northrend_Boss4_EnemyScreenLine_01	Medivh’s enchanted chessboard?! Is this... Karazhan?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Northrend_Boss5_EnemyScreenLine_01	Who's this?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Northrend_Boss6_EnemyScreenLine_01	What is the League of E.V.I.L. doing in Blackrock Mountain?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss8_EnemyScreenLine_01	I’ve always wanted to see the Gurubashi Arena!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Northrend_Boss4_Victory_01	Checkmate! Reno, take us away!

VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Northrend_Boss8_Victory1_01	That was GREAT! You shoulda seen your faces. Okay, here’s one more portal.

VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_UI_Good_CallToAction_03_01	Why are you schemin’ with those E.V.I.L. types? We’ve got ta rescue Reno an’ save the world!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_UI_Evil_CallToAction_02_01	Hey we got a bunch of E.V.I.L. cards over here, if you want ‘em. Yeah. You do!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_02_Victory_01	Thank you, Khadgar. Now that we have our beach-head, you can portal in the other displaced mages.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_Book_Reveal_01	Our objective is to find out what Rafaam is plotting… and put a stop to it!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_CallToAction_01_01	The League of Explorers needs your help, don’t let us down!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_Chapter_01_Complete_01	We made it ashore… barely. We need some allies. And wings!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_Chapter_01_Intro_01	What's this? E.V.I.L. is patrolling the coast… from the air!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_Chapter_01_Unlock_01	To Northrend! One way or another, the battle will be decided here.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_Chapter_02_Complete_01	Rafaam is trying to resurrect Galakrond!? He must be stopped!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_Chapter_02_Intro_01	Wyrmrest Temple, ancient home of the dragons.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_Chapter_02_Unlock_01	We must journey to Wyrmrest Temple to find help.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_Chapter_03_Complete_01	We've surrounded the city. Let's hope we're not too late…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_Chapter_03_Intro_01	Everyone, to the skies! We've got to get to Dalaran, fast!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_Chapter_03_Unlock_01	This is the largest air battle Azeroth has ever seen!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_Chapter_04_Complete_01	We stopped Rafaam, without a minute to spare. Reno, are you okay?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_Chapter_04_Complete_Alt_01	We defeated Rafaam, and Galakrond has returned to dust!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_Chapter_04_Intro_01	Split up! Capture the city - I'm going to find Reno!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_Chapter_04_Unlock_01	Dalaran is an occupied city. Be careful in there!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_First_Defeat_01	Everyone, regroup! There will be setbacks, but we MUST persevere!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_09h_Female_Troll_UI_Evil_CallToAction_03_01	I see a button in your future… an E.V.I.L. button… You should click it!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_UI_Evil_Book_Reveal_01	Explorers? In Northrend!? Can I not scheme in peace!?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_UI_Evil_CallToAction_01_01	Stop wasting time with those Explorers. Come back to E.V.I.L. and join the winning side!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_UI_Evil_Chapter_01_Complete_01	That should take care of those explorers. Notify me of their surrender.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_UI_Evil_Chapter_01_Intro_01	Stop them! Take no prisoners! Wait - no - take one! Mwa-hahah!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_UI_Evil_Chapter_01_Unlock_01	Meet them at the coast. Dive-bomb them from the air!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_UI_Evil_Chapter_02_Complete_01	We have found the remains of Galakrond! I am moving Dalaran into place…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_UI_Evil_Chapter_02_Intro_01	Tear that temple apart. We must learn the location of Galakrond's remains!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_UI_Evil_Chapter_02_Unlock_01	We must now learn the secrets of the dragonflights…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_UI_Evil_Chapter_03_Complete_01	Is this the best we can do? I am running out of henchmen!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_UI_Evil_Chapter_03_Intro_01	I need time to resurrect Galakrond. Hold them off! Fill the skies with fury!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_UI_Evil_Chapter_03_Unlock_01	Scramble the airships! I must not be disturbed!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_UI_Evil_Chapter_04_Complete_01	When the ashes settle, those that remain will quake in fear of the name… RAFAAAM!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_UI_Evil_Chapter_04_Intro_01	So they want Dalaran back, do they? Let them come!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_UI_Evil_Chapter_04_Unlock_01	After a year of plotting and scheming… this is our moment!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_UI_Evil_Final_Victory_01_01	And so, Rafaam disappeared into the shadows, the most feared villain of all time.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_UI_Evil_Final_Victory_01_02	And so, Rafaam disappeared into the shadows, the most feared villain of all time. That’s right, I am doing my own narration. I AM RAFAAM!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_UI_Evil_First_Defeat_01	What separates us from our enemies is the disposability of our henchmen. Try again!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_UI_Good_Final_Victory_01	I'm fine! A little fuzzy on what happened at the end. Did we win? Yay!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_UI_Splash_Page_01	This is the big one, folks. We're taking the fight to E.V.I.L.!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_UI_Good_CallToAction_02_01	Our situation is looking awfully dire. Can the League of Explorers count on your help, my friend?

VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Evil_Fight_01_CoinSelect_01	Explorers coming ashore! Kriziki, do a fly-by! Don't let 'em get a foothold!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_02_CoinSelect_01	Lazul. There are monstrosities hidden in the snow. Unleash them!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Evil_Fight_03_CoinSelect_01	Oh yeah hold on, one of those explorers is goin' all cowboy. I'm gonna get 'im!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_04_CoinSelect_01	Fan out, miscreants. We must learn the secrets of the dragons.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_05_CoinSelect_01	Some explorers are snooping around the temple. Kronx! Destroy them.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_06_CoinSelect_01	Hagatha - get down from there! That's a storm dragon!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_07_CoinSelect_01	I just need… more time… Everyone! To the skies!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_08_CoinSelect_01	They've circled the city. Eudora, are you there? Blast them!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_09_CoinSelect_01	Eudora! You're the only one left out there. Hold them off!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_10_CoinSelect_01	Burn it down, Rakanishu! If we can't have this city… NO ONE CAN!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_CoinSelect_01	My work is almost complete - what? Who is at the door? GO AWAY!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_12_CoinSelect_01	Oh, Galakrond! It is just you and me now. *Sniff* I know what I must do.

VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_01_CoinSelect_01	Brann, Reno's in trouble! How fast can you get there?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_02_CoinSelect_01	Khadgar, they've unleashed an elemental against us. Help!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_03_CoinSelect_01	There - up in the sky! Let's bring that bird down…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_UI_Good_04_CoinSelect_01	This place is in chaos. Finley! What's happening?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_UI_Good_05_CoinSelect_01	This temple crawls with… cultists! What're they after!?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_UI_Good_06_CoinSelect_01	They're after Galakrond! The Ur-dragon, the ancient menace that took all five dragonflights to defeat!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_07_CoinSelect_01	Brann! Get airborne - what do you see up there?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_08_CoinSelect_01	That Gronn menace is downing our dragons! We need help!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_UI_Good_09_CoinSelect_01	Hurry. We need to reach Dalaran before they raise Galakrond!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Good_Fight_10_CoinSelect_01	Everyone, into the city! Oh my - where's Karl?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Good_Fight_11_CoinSelect_01	Elise! I've secured the bank - but Reno is still trapped in the Violet Hold!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_12_CoinSelect_01	Lock down the city, everyone. I'm going after Rafaam!

VO_DRGA_BOSS_13h_Female_Arakkoa_Evil_Fight_01_Concede_01	Back to the skies for now!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_13h_Female_Arakkoa_Evil_Fight_01_Misc_01b_01	Why surrender when victory is in my claws?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_13h_Female_Arakkoa_Evil_Fight_01_PlayerStart_01	Back to the sea with you, wretched murloc! Raak!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_01_Turn_02_01	How could the explorers be HERE? I wasted like… five plagues on those fools!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Evil_Fight_01_Boss_HeroPower_01_01	Charge forth, explorers!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Evil_Fight_01_Boss_HeroPower_02_01	Stop those fiends!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Evil_Fight_01_Boss_HeroPower_03_01	Battle on, brave warriors!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Evil_Fight_01_BossAttack_01	Have at thee!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Evil_Fight_01_BossStart_01	Well, that was quite rude!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Evil_Fight_01_BossStartHeroic_01	I am Sir Finley Mrrgglton. Prepare to be smited!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Evil_Fight_01_EmoteResponse_01	Oh dear. Do you squawk at your mother with that beak?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Evil_Fight_01_EmoteResponseHeroic_01	I think our differences could be resolved over a cup of tea.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Evil_Fight_01_Finely_Bubblehearth_01_01	I say, that was far too close for comfort! I'll be going then!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Evil_Fight_01_Finely_Bubblehearth_02_01	Time for a hasty retreat! Ta-ta!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Evil_Fight_01_Idle_01_01	Another evil doer who will fall by my scaled hand!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Evil_Fight_01_Idle_02_01	What could E.V.I.L. want here in Northrend?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Evil_Fight_01_Idle_03_01	I'm liable to become a frozen fish filet if I stay out here too long! <_Brr_>
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Evil_Fight_01_Misc_01a_01	Winged champion - would you perhaps consider a surrender?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Evil_Fight_01_Misc_02_01	It was worth asking politely, I suppose!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Evil_Fight_01_Misc_03_01	These E.V.I.L. Lackeys are proving to be quite the bother…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Evil_Fight_01_Misc_04_01	You E.V.I.L. bunch are resilient! Tekahn was no joke either.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Evil_Fight_01_Misc_05_01	This is definitely not going my way!


VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_Boss_Death_01	I will… obey…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_Boss_FreezeSpell_01	Your destruction will come…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_Boss_HeroPower_01_01	From frost, we rise!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_Boss_HeroPower_02_01	We are all around you.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_Boss_HeroPower_03_01	This will be your grave…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_Boss_Moorabi_01	This troll… a worthy champion.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_Boss_SnowfuryGiant_01	We rise against you!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_BossAttack_01	<_Attack_>
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_BossStart_01	Chenvaala will not obey…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_BossStartHeroic_01	The frost… will take you….
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_EmoteResponse_01	Freeze your tongue...
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_Idle_01_01	We will not melt away.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_Idle_02_01	Our power shall not be harnessed… by anyone.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_Idle_03_01	Your heart… is as cold as ours….
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_Player_FreezeMinion_01	You delay the inevitable.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_Player_Misc01_01	You will be stopped! This dark power is not to be wielded!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_PlayerHeroic_FrostLichJaina_01	A master of frost… corrupted by evil…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_PlayerHeroic_PyroblastFace_01	I'm meltiiiing!!!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_Puppeteering_01	Our power is not yours to wield.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_22h_Male_Gronn_Evil_Fight_02_Skruk_Awakened_01	Skruk is awake! Time… to slay… dragons!!!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_09h_Female_Troll_Evil_Fight_02_PlayerStart_01	Rise up from de ice… unleash your power!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_09h_Female_Troll_Evil_Fight_02_Story_01_01	You can try to resist… your power will be mine…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_09h_Female_Troll_Evil_Fight_02_Story_02_01	And this dragonslayer… he shall be useful as well!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_09h_Female_Troll_Evil_Fight_02_Story_03_01	I tire of this snowball fight… let us finish this quickly.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_09h_Female_Troll_Evil_Fight_02_Story_04_01	Rafaam will be pleased. Now let us raise something else…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_Story_05_01	The Dragonslayer cannot be stopped… do not awaken him!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_Story_06_01	The power of Northrend… cannot be corrupted.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_Story_07_01	What… do you plan?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_25h_Female_Elemental_Evil_Fight_02_Story_08_01	Terrible evil lurks here… leave…


VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Evil_Fight_03_Misc_01_Hero_01	I didn't get my doctorate in explosions for you to call me MISTER!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Evil_Fight_03_Misc_02_Hero_01	Capturing this clown should make this whole battle a loooot easier.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Evil_Fight_03_Misc_03_Hero_01	I've gotta respect that big boomstick of his, though!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Evil_Fight_03_Misc_04_Hero_01	Haha! That's one down. Who's got next?!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Evil_Fight_03_PlayerStart_01	Hey you, step up! I got a big friendly claw, it wants to say 'Hi!'
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Boss_BigAOESpell_01	Let's blow up ALL of these jerks.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Boss_BigSpellFace_01	Take THAT! Haha, headshot!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Boss_Death_01	Wait… I lost? Help!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Boss_HeroPowerTrigger_01_01	Woohoo! Full auto!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Boss_HeroPowerTrigger_02_01	Bang bang bang - this never gets old!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Boss_HeroPowerTrigger_03_01	It's a two-for-one sale on butt kickings!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Boss_RogueSpell_01	I may have massive magical power now… but I'm still sneaky!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_BossAttack_01	Hahaha!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_BossStart_01	Hey! There's a bad guy! Let's try some new spells!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_BossStartHeroic_01	Ready to see some magic?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_EmoteResponse_01	What? What?! This wand is REALLY LOUD!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Idle_01_01	Does this thing need to be reloaded? Hmm.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Idle_02_01	These bad guys aren't so tough after all! Easy!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Idle_03_01	What's with all the waiting around? Scared I might beat ya?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Misc_01_01	Hey… wait. Where's the rest of the Explorers?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Misc_02_01	Elise did say something about not charging ahead…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Misc_03_01	But I DO have all of this magical mystical might. So it should be totally fine!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Misc_04_01	OK OK, it's not fine! This guy's tough!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Misc_05_01	Hey, Mister Boom! Hi. Can I just… run away for a bit?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Player_BigMech_01	I'll make short work of that big, scary bucket of bolts! Probably!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Player_Bomb_01	What does that thing do? Why are you putting it into my deck?!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Player_BrannMinion_01	Brann, buddy. Let's get out of here…. Right? Right?!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Player_EliseMinion_01	Elise! I' m sorry for running ahead but… let's not fight!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Player_FinleyMinion_01	Finley! What the heck are you doing over there?! Come and help ME!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Player_LoEMinion_01	Wait now, which one of us is on the wrong side?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Player_Pilfer_01	Hey! That's my hat! Give it back!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Player_RenoHero_01	Look at that roguishly handsome hero!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_03_Player_RenoMinion_01	Don't I know it!


VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_Boss_Death_01	You will… regret this…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_Boss_HeroPower1Trigger_01_01	The fury of dragons!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_Boss_HeroPower1Trigger_02_01	Mighty are these dragons!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_Boss_HeroPower1Trigger_03_01	Fall before us!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_Boss_HeroPower2Trigger_01_01	The power of magic!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_Boss_HeroPower2Trigger_02_01	Deadly is this magic!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_Boss_HeroPower2Trigger_03_01	You shall crumble!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_BossAttack_01	<_Attack_>
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_BossStart_01	Pathetic minions of evil, you will learn no secrets here!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_BossStartHeroic_01	You are not welcome at Wyrmrest.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_EmoteResponse_01	I know your tricks, Kobold.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_EmoteResponseHeroic_01	You stand no chance here.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_Idle_01_01	Attacking Wyrmrest is truly a fool's errand.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_Idle_02_01	You waste my time. I should be helping the others.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_Idle_03_01	What do you hope to accomplish here?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_Misc_01_01	That... dragon's... candle? What are you talking about?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_Misc_02_01	I'm… still not following you.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_Misc_03_01	They want to raise dragons of their own… we must stop them!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_Misc_04_01	Call for help! Alert the dragonflights!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_Misc_05_01	The dragonflights must stop them!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_Player_DragonAspect_01	An aspect? Are you… under Galakrond's control?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_26h_Female_Draenei_Evil_Fight_04_Player_Waxadred_01	I've never seen such a uniquely... goopy dragon.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Hero_Attack_01	<_Attack_>
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Hero_Concede_01	Ok, be giving up now. Hmph!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Hero_Death_01	The king… is kaput…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Hero_Emote_Greetings_01	Hello!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Hero_Emote_Oops_01	This worse than when I crash Dalaran.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Hero_Emote_Thanks_01	Ah, I am thanking you.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Hero_Emote_Threaten_01	I gonna beats ya! Beat yoooou!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Hero_Emote_WellPlayed_01	Nice, nice, nicely done!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Hero_Emote_Wow_01	By the big candle!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Hero_Error_01	Cannot do.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Hero_Low_Cards_01	Running low on cards!!!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Hero_Out_Of_Cards_01	Deck burnt out!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Hero_Thinking_01_01	Hmmm…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Hero_Thinking_02_01	Thinking…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Hero_Thinking_03_01	What I do...
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Hero_Time_01	Candle burning down to wick…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Misc_01_01	Be talking quickly now - dragon is big candles, no? Both breathing fire?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Misc_02_01	Need dragons. Have wax. You haves magic. Give!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Misc_03_01	GIVE ME YOUR DRAGON MAGICS!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Misc_04_01	Haha! Now you gets it!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_Misc_05_01	Flappy dragons be stopping nothing… This I am promising!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Evil_Fight_04_PlayerStart_01	You! Be telling me how to make BIG dragons!


VO_DRGA_BOSS_27ha_Male_Dwarf_Evil_Fight_05_Boss_HeroPower_01_01	All together now!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27ha_Male_Dwarf_Evil_Fight_05_BossAttack_01_01	Hit 'em!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27ha_Male_Dwarf_Evil_Fight_05_BossStart_01_01	Whoa! Who is this big fella?!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27ha_Male_Dwarf_Evil_Fight_05_BossStartHeroic_01_01	Whoa! Who are you?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27ha_Male_Dwarf_Evil_Fight_05_EmoteResponse_01_01	I'm a full-fledged explorer, ya can't scare me!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27ha_Male_Dwarf_Evil_Fight_05_Idle_01_01	Brann's been teachin' me patience… it ain't workin'!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27ha_Male_Dwarf_Evil_Fight_05_Misc_01_01	We are the…

VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hb_Female_NightElf_Evil_Fight_05_Boss_HeroPower_02_01	With our power combined!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hb_Female_NightElf_Evil_Fight_05_BossAttack_02_01	Let's go!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hb_Female_NightElf_Evil_Fight_05_BossStart_02_01	He looks like he means business. Be on your guard!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hb_Female_NightElf_Evil_Fight_05_BossStartHeroic_02_01	Whoever they are, they look like trouble!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hb_Female_NightElf_Evil_Fight_05_EmoteResponse_02_01	We've got some exploring to do. Please step aside!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hb_Female_NightElf_Evil_Fight_05_Idle_02_01	We REALLY need to get moving!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hb_Female_NightElf_Evil_Fight_05_Misc_02_01	Explorer's League!

VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hc_Female_Human_Evil_Fight_05_Boss_HeroPower_03_01	Go Team Explorers!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hc_Female_Human_Evil_Fight_05_BossAttack_03_01	Hi yah!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hc_Female_Human_Evil_Fight_05_EmoteResponse_03_01	Hmm. Is that a clue?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hc_Female_Human_Evil_Fight_05_Idle_03_01	There must be something about this guy that we can learn…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hc_Female_Human_Evil_Fight_05_Misc_03_01	And we are in need…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hc_Female_Human_Evil_Fight_05_Misc_05_01	The… camel?! Why would you bring the camel?!

VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hd_Male_Gnome_Evil_Fight_05_Boss_HeroPower_04_01	Teamwork makes the dream work!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hd_Male_Gnome_Evil_Fight_05_BossAttack_04_01	Alright!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hd_Male_Gnome_Evil_Fight_05_EmoteResponse_04_01	You lookin' for a fight? We can fight!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hd_Male_Gnome_Evil_Fight_05_Idle_04_01	Let's finish this fight already!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hd_Male_Gnome_Evil_Fight_05_Misc_04_01	Of explorers!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_27hd_Male_Gnome_Evil_Fight_05_Misc_06_01	I thought it could help us! And it did!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Hero_Attack_01	<_Attack_>
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Hero_Concede_01	Galakrond will forgive me… I hope…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Hero_Death_01	For… Galakrond…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Hero_Emote_Greetings_01	A greeting before your demise.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Hero_Emote_Oops_01	Hm. For shame.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Hero_Emote_Thanks_01	That will do.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Hero_Emote_Threaten_01	You stand against Galakrond's fist.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Hero_Emote_WellPlayed_01	Galakrond smiles upon this.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Hero_Emote_Wow_01	Most impressive.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Hero_Error_01	That will not work.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Hero_Low_Cards_01	I am nearly out of cards.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Hero_Out_Of_Cards_01	My deck is empty. Disappointing.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Hero_Thinking_01_01	Hmm…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Hero_Thinking_02_01	How shall I best serve the Master…?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Hero_Thinking_03_01	How long until he returns?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Hero_Time_01	I must be swift. There is much to do.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Misc_01_01	Is that… a camel? In Northrend?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Misc_02_01	It is foolish for you to intervene here, explorers.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Misc_03_01	Galakrond's resurrection will spell doom for all of Azeroth!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Misc_04_01	Rafaam thinks he can control my master… he must be a fool.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Misc_05_01	My people have waited for this for so very long.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_Misc_06_01	The sun has set for you.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_28h_Male_Tauren_Evil_Fight_05_PlayerStart_01	These "explorers" will not get in the way of Master's return!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_05_Turn_03_01	The final plague is ready, Kronx. Stop playing and find the remains of Galakrond!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_06h_Female_Orc_Evil_Fight_06_Misc_01_Hero_01	You will regret that, overgrown fool.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_06h_Female_Orc_Evil_Fight_06_Misc_02_Hero_01	Come come come, Nithogg. This won't hurt… much.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_06h_Female_Orc_Evil_Fight_06_Misc_03_Hero_01	Now… now you are mine!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_06h_Female_Orc_Evil_Fight_06_Misc_04_Hero_01	With the storm drake under my control, the Fist of Ra-Den shall be mine!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_06h_Female_Orc_Evil_Fight_06_PlayerStart_01	I've corrupted MUCH more powerful monsters. Watch me work.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_20h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_06_Boss_HeroPower_01_01	The storm rages!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_20h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_06_Boss_HeroPower_02_01	Lightning is mine to control!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_20h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_06_Boss_HeroPower_03_01	Do not dare to stand before me!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_20h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_06_BossAttack_01	<_Attack_>
VO_DRGA_BOSS_20h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_06_BossStart_01	You will NOT take Wyrmrest!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_20h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_06_EmoteResponse_01	Where did you learn to speak such evil?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_20h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_06_Idle_01_01	You soil this place with your presence.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_20h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_06_Idle_02_01	Such foul magic in the air… disgusting.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_20h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_06_Idle_03_01	Have you already given up?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_20h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_06_Misc_01_01	You seek to corrupt me?! Bah! Your swamp magic has no place here.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_20h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_06_Misc_02_01	Feel the full might of the dragonflights!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_20h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_06_Misc_03_01	You really hope to overpower a storm dragon?!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_20h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_06_Misc_04a_01	Do you know what happens when an orc is struck by lightning?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_20h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_06_Misc_04b_01	The same thing as everything else!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_23h_Female_Forsaken_Evil_Fight_07_Boss_Dragondies_01_01	You will be avenged!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_23h_Female_Forsaken_Evil_Fight_07_Boss_Dragondies_02_01	Where one falls, others will rise…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_23h_Female_Forsaken_Evil_Fight_07_Boss_Dragondies_03_01	The spirit lives on!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_23h_Female_Forsaken_Evil_Fight_07_Boss_WillOfForsaken_01_01	In death there is power…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_23h_Female_Forsaken_Evil_Fight_07_Boss_WillOfForsaken_02_01	We will not be broken.

VO_DRGA_BOSS_31h_Female_Vupera_Evil_Fight_08_PlayerStart_01	I'm drawin' a line in the sky an' NOBODY crosses it!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_30h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_08_BossStart_01	Come about! There's a ship between us and the city!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_30h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_08_EmoteResponse_01	Is she… signaling us? Signal back! Use the rude flags!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_30h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_08_Idle_01_01	Steady lads. She won't out-fox us!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_30h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_08_Idle_02_01	How many guns has she got on that thing?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_30h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_08_Idle_03_01	Do we have any incendiary shot? …what do you mean it burned up?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_14h_Female_Vulpera_Evil_Fight_09_HeroPower_01_01	I need backup!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_14h_Female_Vulpera_Evil_Fight_09_HeroPower_02_01	Beat to quarters!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_14h_Female_Vulpera_Evil_Fight_09_HeroPower_03_01	All hands on deck!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_14h_Female_Vulpera_Evil_Fight_09_PlayerStart_01	Steady on, crew! We're the last line of defense!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_14h_Female_Vulpera_Evil_Fight_09_SelfDestruct_01_01	Blow it up! Blast the ship!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_14h_Female_Vulpera_Evil_Fight_09_SelfDestruct_02_01	Scuttle the ship, take out as many as you can!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_14h_Female_Vulpera_Evil_Fight_09_Turn01_Event_01_01	Shiverin' tailfur, that's a lot of dragons.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_14h_Female_Vulpera_Evil_Fight_09_Turn02_Event_02_01	Can ya triumph a little faster over there?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_14h_Female_Vulpera_Evil_Fight_09_Turn03_Event_01_01	Don't give up! We just need to hold them off for - what!?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_14h_Female_Vulpera_Evil_Fight_09_Turn03_Event_02_01	…oh come on! Stupid time dragons!!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_14h_Female_Vulpera_Evil_Fight_09_Turn04_Event_01_01	Rafaam! There are more dragons out here than… not dragons!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_14h_Female_Vulpera_Evil_Fight_09_Turn05_Event_01_01	Okay… okay… Maybe we gotta play dirty? I do dirty!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_14h_Female_Vulpera_Evil_Fight_09_Turn06_Event_01_01	I want these dragons OFF the deck of my SHIP!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_14h_Female_Vulpera_Evil_Fight_09_Turn07_Event_01_01	Dragons… everywhere… RAFAAM!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_14h_Female_Vulpera_Evil_Fight_09_Turn08_Event_01_01	I've gotta find a new evil league. This one stinks.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_14h_Female_Vulpera_Evil_Fight_09_Turn09_Event_01_01	Booby-trap the decks! Un-moor the cannons! Turn this ship into a dragon-trap!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_14h_Female_Vulpera_Evil_Fight_09_Turn10_Event_01_01	Rafaam - how's that master plan coming along?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_14h_Female_Vulpera_Evil_Fight_09_Victory_01_01	I'm done! I'm out! Next time you form an evil league, find a different pirate!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_09_Turn02_Event_01_01	Keep them at bay, Eudora. Our moment of triumph is near!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_09_Turn04_Event_02_01	I place my trust in you, Eudora! Plus, everyone else has been eaten.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_09_Turn07_Event_02_01	You're fine, Eudora! I think.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_09_Turn07_Event_03_01	From here, all I can see is an enormous cloud of angry dragons.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_09_Turn10_Event_02_01	We do not rush master plans! They are done when they are done.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_09_Victory_02_01	Eudora - Get back here! You haven’t tried fighting them with your fists yet!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_32h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_09_BossAttack_01	<_Angry roar!_>
VO_DRGA_BOSS_32h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_09_BossStart_01	<_Multiple Dragon Roars_>

VO_DRGA_BOSS_32h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_09_DragonDies_02_01	<_Snappy roar_>
VO_DRGA_BOSS_32h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_09_DragonDies_03_01	<_Long, aggravated roar!_>
VO_DRGA_BOSS_32h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_09_EmoteResponse_01	<_Confused roar_>
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Boss_Death_George_01	Sorry… Karl…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Boss_GeorgeIdle_01_01	All this chaos, and for what?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Boss_GeorgeIdle_02_01	How did I get wrapped up in this?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Boss_GeorgeIdle_03_01	I miss the old days. They were simpler.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Boss_HeroPower_01_George_01	This oughta help put you down…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Boss_HeroPower_02_George_01	A mighty weapon… for revenge!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Boss_Karl_Dies_01	No! I won't lose him again!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_BossAttack_George_01	Fall, demon!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_BossStart_01_01	We're going to stop you, you overgrown candle!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_BossStartHeroic_01_01	We're back and better than ever!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_EmoteResponse_George_01	I'm not gonna listen to your lies anymore, E.V.I.L.!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_George_Carts_01_01	I don't think anyone is going to miss those carts.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_George_Carts_02_01	I know it's wrong but, seeing those carts burn is… cathartic.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_George_Misc_01_01	We can do this! …
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_George_Misc_02_01	Let's work as a tag team!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_George_Misc_03_01	…yes. You do.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_George_Misc_04_01	Can we really win?!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_George_Misc_05_01	Karl… I think we're gonna lose!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_George_PostTransform_01_01	How are we even going to hit this big guy in the face?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_George_PostTransform_02_01	If Karl did a front flip, and then I gave him a boost…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Boss_Death_Karl_01	I let ya down again…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Boss_GeorgeDies_01	George! No! I will… avenge you!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Boss_HeroPower_01_Karl_01	The Light will protect me!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Boss_HeroPower_02_Karl_01	Time to play defensively!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Boss_KarlIdle_01_01	I'm so glad George and I could fight together again.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Boss_KarlIdle_02_01	George didn't deserve any of this.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Boss_KarlIdle_03_01	I missed our high fives!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_BossAttack_Karl_01	Stand down!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_BossStart_02_01	Yeah! We're gonna… put you out!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_BossStartHeroic_02_01	Yeah! A dream team!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_EmoteResponse_Karl_01	Get outta here, you big bully!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Karl_Carts_01_01	Uhhh George? There's a lot of fire…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Karl_Carts_02_01	Those poor, poor fruits! You fiend!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Karl_LeagueOfExplorers_01	Wait a minute.. Didn't we meet in Uldum?!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Karl_Misc_01_01	…together!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Karl_Misc_02_01	Do I get to control the deck?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Karl_Misc_03_01	Oh boy!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Karl_Misc_04_01	I hope we can win!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Karl_Misc_05_01	Then we lose together, George!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_10_Karl_Misc_06_01	So glad George decided to come with me!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_10_Turn_03_01	Burn everything! Oh, except the drapes. I just had them steamed.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_16h_Male_Elemental_Evil_Fight_10_Misc_01_01	You two make a TERRIBLE team!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_16h_Male_Elemental_Evil_Fight_10_Misc_02_01	Dalaran... it's nice and toasty this time of year!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_16h_Male_Elemental_Evil_Fight_10_PlayerStart_01	By fire… be purged!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_16h_Male_Elemental_Evil_Fight_10_Rakanishu_EmoteResponseALT_01	You two STILL make a terrible team!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_16h_Male_Elemental_Evil_Fight_10_Rakanishu_HeroPower_01_01	Let's set these ablaze!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_16h_Male_Elemental_Evil_Fight_10_Rakanishu_HeroPower_02_01	Things are REALLY heating up!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_16h_Male_Elemental_Evil_Fight_10_Rakanishu_HeroPower_03_01	Nice and FLAMMABLE!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_16h_Male_Elemental_Evil_Fight_10_Rakanishu_HeroPower_04_01	Burn it! BURN IT ALL!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_16h_Male_Elemental_Evil_Fight_10_Rakanishu_HeroPower_05_01	FLAMES WILL CONSUME!!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_16h_Male_Elemental_Evil_Fight_10_Rakanishu_HeroPower_06_01	Wahaha! Hahahaha!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_16h_Male_Elemental_Evil_Fight_10_Rakanishu_Transform_01	Fire… Fire! FIRE!!!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_37h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_Boss_Death_Anduin_01	Ahhh!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_37h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_Boss_HeroPower_01_Anduin_01	For Stormwind!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_37h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_Boss_HeroPower_02_Anduin_01	We fight as one!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_37h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_Boss_HeroPower_03_Anduin_01	Stand your ground, everyone!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_37h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_BossAttack_Anduin_01	For the light!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_37h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_BossStart_Anduin_01	You will never take Stormwind.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_37h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_EmoteResponse_Anduin_01	The Alliance has faced worse than this.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_37h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_Idle_01_Anduin_01	It was only a couple years ago that we repaired these gates.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_37h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_Idle_02_Anduin_01	Something about Stormwind is like a dragon-magnet.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Galakrond_Awesome_01_01	Oh Galakrond! What a joy to watch you work!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Galakrond_Awesome_02_01	Galakrond… save some for me!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Galakrond_Awesome_03_01	Good boy! Heh heh - that is my dragon.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Galakrond_Awesome_04_01	Galakrond, look how much you've grown!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Galakrond_Awesome_05_01	Hah-HAH! I have the most epic mount!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Galakrond_Awesome_06a_01	Laugh with me Galakrond! It is no fun to evil laugh alone.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Galakrond_Awesome_06b_01	Ahhh, your laughter is mirthless. You should live in the moment more.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Galakrond_Born_01	Arise, Galakrond. ARISE!!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Galakrond_LateGame_01a_01	This victory leaves me feeling empty inside.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Galakrond_LateGame_01b_01	Which is ironic, given that I am a hollow shell of bandages.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Galakrond_LateGame_02_01	Easy, Galakrond! If you destroy Azeroth, none will be left to FEAR me.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Galakrond_LateGame_03_01	Have I gone too far? Quiet, Galakrond! I am thinking.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Galakrond_LateGame_04_01	Perhaps my mother was right. Maybe I AM terrible and unworthy of love.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Galakrond_Victory_01	A bittersweet win… FOR RAFAAM!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Hero_Attack_01	Destroy!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Hero_Concede_01	Back to the scheming-board!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Hero_Death_01	But… but…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Hero_Emote_Greetings_01	Witness my magnificence, and despair!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Hero_Emote_Oops_01	I do not make mistakes. I play… unorthodoxically.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Hero_Emote_Thanks_01	Thank you. I will destroy you last.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Hero_Emote_Threaten_01	Galakrond will be your end!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Hero_Emote_Threaten_Explorers_01	I will get you. AND YOUR LITTLE MURLOC, TOO!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Hero_Emote_WellPlayed_01	This is a good game! I am so skilled!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_Hero_Emote_Wow_01	AMAZING! I am speaking mostly of myself.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_PlayerStart_01	You! You are just in time to witness the culmination of my genius.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_PlayerStart_Anduin_01	I am Rafaam. I TAKE EVERYTHING!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_PlayerStart_Sylvanas_a_01	Oh banshee queen, banshee queen, banshee queen…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_11_PlayerStart_Sylvanas_b_01	I know a thing or two about raising the dead. You think TOO SMALL!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_Boss_Death_Reno_01	Wait - no!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_Boss_HeroPower_01_Reno_01	Heads up!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_Boss_HeroPower_02_Reno_01	This thing didn't come with instructions!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_Boss_HeroPower_03_Reno_01	Whoa this thing's pretty squirrely.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_Boss_HeroPower_04_Reno_01	Oops. Was that me?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_Boss_HeroPower_05_Reno_01	Pretty sure whatever I just did I meant to do it!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_BossAttack_Reno_01	Heee-YAH!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_BossAttack_Reno_02	<_Attack_>
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_BossStart_Reno_01	And you're just in time to witness... The opposite!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_EmoteResponse_Reno_01	I will miss our witty banter.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_Idle_01_Reno_01	When they said I couldn't be an explorer, I explored stuff anyways.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_Idle_02_Reno_01	When they said I couldn't do magic, I magicked stuff anyways.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Evil_Fight_11_Idle_03_Reno_01	They say I can't defeat you... but look at me now! Yeah!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_38h_Female_Forsaken_Evil_Fight_11_Boss_HeroPower_01_Sylvanas_01	Arise!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_38h_Female_Forsaken_Evil_Fight_11_Boss_HeroPower_02_Sylvanas_01	All will serve the Horde. In time.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_38h_Female_Forsaken_Evil_Fight_11_Boss_HeroPower_03_Sylvanas_01	Let none survive!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_38h_Female_Forsaken_Evil_Fight_11_BossAttack_Sylvanas_01	For the Horde!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_38h_Female_Forsaken_Evil_Fight_11_BossStart_Sylvanas_01	Your reign of terror ends here, Rafaam.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_38h_Female_Forsaken_Evil_Fight_11_EmoteResponse_Sylvanas_01	Why do my foes feel the need to talk? Incessantly?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_38h_Female_Forsaken_Evil_Fight_11_Idle_01_Sylvanas_01	I have no time for games.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_38h_Female_Forsaken_Evil_Fight_11_Idle_02_Sylvanas_01	…except this game.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_38h_Female_Forsaken_Evil_Fight_11_Idle_03_Sylvanas_01	I main a mech paladin. That surprises a lot of people.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_24h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_12_Boss_HeroPower_01_01	Annihilate.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_24h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_12_Boss_HeroPower_02_01	To oblivion.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_24h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_12_Boss_HeroPower_03_01	None will remain.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_24h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_12_BossAttack_01	Hrruuuuaah!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_24h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_12_BossStart_01	I am the beginning. I am the ur-dragon. You are nothing.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_24h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_12_EmoteResponse_01	Your role in this is over, ethereal.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_24h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_12_Idle_01_01	I am the Progenitor. The beginning. The one.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_24h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_12_Idle_02_01	My rebirth begins the cycle of the world anew.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_24h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_12_Idle_03_01	You, too are the beginning. The "Appetizer." The "Snack."
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_12_Hero_Emote_Greetings_01	Hello, Galakrond! And now… goodbye.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_12_Hero_Emote_Oops_01	We have both made mistakes, my friend.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_12_Hero_Emote_Thanks_01	You will always be my greatest creation.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_12_Hero_Emote_Threaten_01	Goodbye, you big beautiful scion of destruction.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_12_Hero_Emote_Wow_01	What a pair we make, Galakrond!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_12_HeroPower_01_01	It is easy to solo a raid boss if you have the right gear.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_12_HeroPower_02_01	I remember stealing these! Good times.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_12_HeroPower_03_01	Ahhh, just what I was looking for.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_12_HeroPower_04_01	It is good to be an arch-thief!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_12_HeroPower_FirstTime_01	It is a good thing I spent all year stealing these things!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_12_Misc_01_01	Oh, Galakrond! I cry. Or I would, if I had liquids in my body.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_12_Misc_02_01	It hurts me to hurt you! Mostly it hurts you, though.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_12_Misc_03_01	Where the others have failed, I, Rafaam, will defeat you.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_12_PlayerStart_01	You are too dangerous, Galakrond. I, Rafaam, must destroy you!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight_12_PlayerStart_b_01	I am RAFAAM!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_Good_Fight_01_PlayerStart_01	It's over, Boom! Put yer hands up an' drop the… giant head!

VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Good_Fight_01_DrBoom_PilotedWhirlOTron_01	Bet you don't know who's piloting this! Neither do I!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Good_Fight_01_DrBoom_Recyclebot_01	Couple of loose screws on that one.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Good_Fight_01_EmoteResponse_01	Yeah, keep talkin'. I'm gonna keep pushin' buttons.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Good_Fight_01_Idle_01_01	Hah! You're shakin' in your little - ooh where'd ya get those boots?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Good_Fight_01_Idle_02_01	You're boomed. I mean, doomed. Eh…you're both!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Good_Fight_01_Idle_03_01	Rafaam has a master plan! I think. He doesn't really loop me in.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Good_Fight_01_Player_Bomb_01	You flatter me, really. I'll flatten you in return.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Good_Fight_01_Player_DrBoom_01	Do I really sound like that when I laugh?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Good_Fight_01_Player_DrBoomHero_01	Wait... you're me now? Okay this is getting weird.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Good_Fight_01_Player_DrBoomsScheme_01	Armor? Who thought of that idea- oh wait it was me.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Good_Fight_01_Player_Invention_01_01	Wait when'd you steal that from me?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Good_Fight_01_Player_Invention_02_01	A genius design! By a mad genius! …Me!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_05h_Male_Goblin_Good_Fight_01_RenoCaptured_01_01	…Got 'im!! Kriziki, fly the prisoner to the Violet Hold!
VO_BOT_238_Male_Goblin_ERROR_HAND_FULL_01	Uh oh. My hand is full.

VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_01_RenoCaptured_02_01	What's that giant bird-looking thing?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_01_RenoCaptured_03_01	Ahh-up!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_01_Turn2_Reno_01	We should get our own flying heads, Brann. Mine can have a gold tooth.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_35h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_02_Boss_Flavor_02_01	Hmmm… no… agree to disagree there, snowfella.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_35h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_02_Khadgar_ArchmageApprentice_01	Medivh's cool and all but, you've got me!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_35h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_02_Khadgar_ArchmageVargoth_01	Vargoth, is it me or are you… copying me?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_35h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_02_Khadgar_AstralPortal_01	Random legendaries are ALWAYS. GOOD.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_35h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_02_Khadgar_Ending_01_01	All done here! I'll go help the others.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_35h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_02_Khadgar_Ending_01_02	That was easy! I've got some hot cocoa waiting for me back at camp!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_35h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_02_Khadgar_FloatingHead_01_01	Ahhh, thank you, me.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_35h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_02_Khadgar_FloatingHead_02_01	Thanks. I guess.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_35h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_02_Khadgar_FloatingHead_03_01	I love that stupid head.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_35h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_02_Khadgar_Kalecgos_01	Ah, such wonderful spells, Kalec!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_35h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_02_Khadgar_Misc_01_01	With some cherry syrup this thing would be refreshing on a hot day.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_35h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_02_Khadgar_Misc_02_01	Elise! They're throwing everything at us. We're going to need help.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_35h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_02_Khadgar_Misc_03_01	Did they… crash… Dalaran?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_35h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_02_Khadgar_Misc_04_01	Can't hide behind innocents here. Feel the full might of an Archmage!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_35h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_02_PlayerStart_01	Well now, what have we here…?

VO_DRGA_BOSS_10h_Male_Elemental_Good_Fight_02_Player_LivingDragonbreath_01	I didn't want to freeze you anyways…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Good_Fight_03_Backstory_01b_01	From Uldum? You brought it here? What are you planning!?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Good_Fight_03_Elise_StandAgainstEvil_01_01	We've got to stand together!

VO_DRGA_BOSS_06h_Female_Orc_Good_Fight_06_Idle_02_01	Our cultists have completed their mission.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_06h_Female_Orc_Good_Fight_06_Idle_03_01	Even if all the dragons rise against us… they are too late!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_06h_Female_Orc_Good_Fight_06_Player_Alexstrasza_01	Dragon breath. Bluh.

VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_Good_Fight_07_RotwingCaptured_01	Go get ‘em, Rotwing! Oh, what a fine beastie. Despite the holes in the wings.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_Good_Fight_07_TurnOne_01	If ye've tamed one dragon, ye've pretty much tamed 'em all, right?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_Good_Fight_07_Victory_01	Easy there… easy! You know, we might have a use for a rotting dragon.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Good_Fight_07_Backstory_01a_01	Brann, about Reno... Does it seem strange how quickly he took to magic?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_19h_Male_Dragon_Good_Fight_07_Boss_HeroPowerTrigger_01_01	Rot away!

VO_DRGA_BOSS_19h_Male_Dragon_Good_Fight_07_Idle_02_01	You will witness Galakrond's return, your armies will not stop us!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_19h_Male_Dragon_Good_Fight_07_Idle_03_01	Despite my name, my wings are actually quite nicely groomed.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_19h_Male_Dragon_Good_Fight_07_Misc_02_01	Your traitorous dragons will learn their place.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_19h_Male_Dragon_Good_Fight_07_Misc_03_01	The dragonflights' overconfidence will be their destruction.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_19h_Male_Dragon_Good_Fight_07_Misc_04_01	My rotten legions will crush you.

VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Idle_01_01	Let's hurry up and finish this, pretender.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Idle_01b_01	It's a shame I never could find Karl…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Idle_02_01	I got my vengeance. I can rest after this.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Idle_03_01	Now that I've really listened, Rafaam has some good points, y'know.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Misc_01_01	That strike… I know that strike!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Misc_02_01	There's no way it's you… you disappeared…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Misc_03_01	They're not bad… they're… misunderstood! Like me!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Misc_04_01	I did a lot of bad things! I helped steal this city!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Misc_05_01	How do I know it's you? It could be… another trick!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Player_Kobold_01	Ugh… kobolds! Horrible creatures!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Player_LostintheJungle_01	Lost… like we were…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Player_Togwaggle_01	You! You filthy good for nothing kobold! It's all YOUR fault!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_11h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Player_Vinecleaver_01	I remember it like it was yesterday… chopping through the jungle together… smiling…

VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Hero_Concede_01	This didn't work out…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Hero_Death_01	Darn it…

VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Hero_Thinking_03_01	What about some of this… or that…?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Hero_Time_01	Gotta hurry up, ol' Karl…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Misc_01_01	George, it's me! It's Karl!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Misc_02_01	I didn't disappear! You disappeared! In the catacombs!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Misc_03_01	George… you're not evil! Stop helping these bad guys!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Misc_04_01	You're a Paladin of the Light! Just like me. I understand you, George!

VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_Misc_06_01	Come back to the light, George! We can be BROS again!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_12h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_10_PlayerStart_01	George!!! It's really you!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Good_Fight_11_Misc_03_01	Reno, Rafaam is trying to resurrect Galakrond. He must be stopped!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Good_Fight_11_Misc_05_01	Reno - find Rafaam and stop him! I'll get the others!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Good_Fight_11_PlayerStart_01	Reno, you're alive! Don't worry, I'll get you out.

VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Good_Fight_11_Player_LivingCandle_02_01	You take and take. ALWAYS TAKE!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Good_Fight_11_Player_LivingCandle_03_01	This is why NO ONE likes adventurers. Grubby grubby.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Good_Fight_11_Player_LivingCandle_04_01	Why?! Why adventurer always take?! They... mine…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_08h_Male_Kobold_Good_Fight_11_Player_Togwaggle_01	Good taste in candle. Mmmm.

VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_11_Reno_Prison_01_01	Elise! I'm in here!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_11_Reno_Prison_02_01	You bring a burger or something? I'm starving!

VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_Good_Fight_12_DrawBrann_01	The city is safe! Now, where's Rafaam?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_Good_Fight_12_RenoDragon_Misc_06_01	Reno! Er - Renogos! We've almost got 'im!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_04h_Male_Dwarf_Good_Fight_12_SummonBrann_01_01	Onward, explorers!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Good_Fight_12_DrawElise_01_01	Reno, I'm here. Listen, the Dragon Queen told me something important -
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Good_Fight_12_DrawElise_Alt_01	Reno, the city is safe. Let's focus on Rafaam!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Good_Fight_12_RenoDragon_EliseReact_01	We learned about your origins at Wyrmrest Temple. Did you ever know?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Good_Fight_12_RenoDragon_Misc_02_01	In dragon years you’d be a juvenile… that explains so much.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Good_Fight_12_RenoDragon_Misc_04b_01	No it doesn’t, Finley. It really doesn’t.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Good_Fight_12_SummonElise_01_Gala_01	Reno, look out! He's trying to resurrect Gala- Oh no.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_02h_Female_NightElf_Good_Fight_12_SummonElise_01_NoGala_01	Reno, look out! He's trying to resurrect Galakrond!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_Boss_Death_01	Impossible…!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_Boss_Invoke_01_01	More power!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_Boss_Invoke_02_01	Yes… for Galakrond!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_Boss_Invoke_03_01	Glorious!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_Boss_Invoke_04_01	He grows ever stronger…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_Boss_Invoke_05_01	Now we are getting somewhere!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_Boss_Invoke_06_01	Yes… YES!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_BossAttack_Gala_01	Get them, Galakrond!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_BossAttack_NoGala_01	<_Attack exertion_>
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_BossStart_01	Reno Jackson! Who let you out? It is impossible to find good help.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_BossStartHeroic_01	You are too late adventurer, Azeroth… will be mine!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_DalaSmash_01	Ram the city into something! Shake them up!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_EmoteResponse_Gala_01	Talk to the dragon because this face does not want to hear it!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_EmoteResponse_NoGala_01	Silence! The culmination of my needlessly complex master plan is at hand!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_Idle_01_01	I have put a LOT of work into this plan.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_Idle_02_01	Forming an E.V.I.L. league… taking a magical city…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_Idle_03_01	And the plagues! They were good fun.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_Idle_04_01	Who would use a plague to raise a dragon? I WOULD! I AM RAFAAM!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_Misc_01_Galakrond_01	Behold, Galakrond! The greatest Dragon, from before dragons were dragons!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_Misc_02_Galakrond_01	He will destroy you! He will smack you around with his teeny-tiny arms!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_Misc_03_Galakrond_01	Look, he destroys foes without being told. Good boy! That is a good boy.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_Misc_04_Galakrond_01	Sit pretty, Galakrond! Ah, he is not pretty. This is fine.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_Misc_05_Galakrond_01	Crush them, Galakrond! I have the greatest job.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_Player_Galakrond_01_01	Wait no! That was MY master plan!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_Player_Galakrond_02_01	Behold, the second Galak- wait there were two?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_RenoDragon_Misc_05_01	My dragon will CRUSH your dragon! Yours has terrible teeth and an awful tan!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Good_Fight_12_RenoDragon_RafaamReact_01	What is this? Stop with the thunder-stealing, you... mustachioed moron!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_12_DrawElise_02_01	That can wait! I'm a bit busy here…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_12_PlayerStart_01	You're all out of villains, Rafaam. It's just you… and me.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_12_RenoDragon_Drawcard_01	There's so much magic here… I don't feel like myself…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_12_RenoDragon_Misc_01a_01	I always knew there was something different about me…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_12_RenoDragon_Misc_01b_01	Ever since I showed up at the orphanage. Inside that egg.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_12_RenoDragon_Misc_03_01	I suppose I always loved sitting around in piles of treasure… oh and magic tricks!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_12_RenoDragon_Transform_01	Wait… wha… My wings feel funny!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_12_SummonBrann_02_01	Let's take this home, Brann!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_12_SummonElise_02_Gala_01	Yeah, I figured that out… eventually.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_12_SummonElise_02_NoGala_01	So THAT'S your plan, eh?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Good_Fight_12_SummonFinley_02_01	Finley! My right-hand mur-man!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Good_Fight_12_DrawFinley_01	The city is secured! Now then, what next?
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Good_Fight_12_RenoDragon_Misc_04a_01	A dragon! Well, that explains why he’d light his flatulence aflame!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_03h_Male_Murloc_Good_Fight_12_SummonFinley_01_01	Tally-hooo!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_24h_Male_Dragon_Evil_Fight_12_Laugh_01	Ha...Ha...Ha
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Hero_Error_01	I cannot do that.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Hero_Low_Cards_01	I am low on cards.
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Hero_Out_of_Cards_01	That's it! I am out!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Hero_Thinking_01_01	Hmmm…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Hero_Thinking_02_01	Must… destroy…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Hero_Thinking_03_01	Chaos…? Yes, chaos…
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Hero_Time_01	I must make my move!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_07h_Male_Ethereal_Evil_Fight__Hero_Emote_WellPlayed_01	Together we were magnificent!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_01h_Male_Human_Attack_01	Ohh, I've got this.
VO_DRG_650_Male_Dragon_Play_02	I am unbreakable! I am unstoppable!
VO_DRG_610_Male_Dragon_Play_01	Darken the skies, my nightmare reigns.
VO_DRG_650_Male_Dragon_Attack_01	Crush the weak!
VO_DRGA_BOSS_21h_EmoteResponse	<_Angry roar!_>
VO_ULDA_Reno_Male_Human_Threaten_01	This might hurt a little.

VO_EX1_614_Male_NightElf_HunterPrince_Attack_02	None may challenge me!
VO_EX1_614_Male_NightElf_HunterPrince_Concede_01	The day is yours.
VO_EX1_614_Male_NightElf_HunterPrince_LowCards_01	I have few cards left.
VO_EX1_614_Male_NightElf_HunterPrince_NoCards_01	I am out of cards.
VO_EX1_614_Male_NightElf_HunterPrince_Start2Response_01	I have sworn to destroy it Arthas! It must be done!
VO_EX1_614_Male_NightElf_HunterPrince_Thanks_01	Thank you.
VO_EX1_614_Male_NightElf_HunterPrince_Time_01	Time is of the essence!
VO_EX1_614_Male_NightElf_HunterPrince_WellPlayed_01	You truly fought well.
VO_EX1_614_Male_NightElf_HunterPrince_Wow_01	An impressive feat.

VO_TB_PrinceHunter_ArthasH_Male_Human_HunterPrince_Loss_01	I know now what I must do. I will not be deterred.
VO_TB_PrinceHunter_ArthasH_Male_Human_HunterPrince_Start1_01	The Frozen Throne is MINE demon! Step aside!
VO_TB_PrinceHunter_ArthasH_Male_Human_HunterPrince_Start3_01	Never!
VO_TB_PrinceHunter_ArthasH_Male_Human_HunterPrince_Attack_01	You will know endless torment!
VO_EX1_614_Male_NightElf_HunterPrince_Attack_02	None may challenge me!

VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Intro01_01	You are not prepared! To go forward, we must go back to the beginning.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Intro02_01	Explore my memories of three fights, and you shall be rewarded.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Intro03_01	This was 10,000 years ago, give or take a few…
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission1_Intro02_01	Very well. We will see who is the stronger brother.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission1_Turn01_Response_01	I don't need to!
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission1_Turn02_Intro_01	You're just upset I didn't follow you to learn from a deer. 
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission1_ExchangeA_02_01	I have yet to find my calling, but it isn't that.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission1_ExchangeB_02_01	Like what, advanced weeding?
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission1_ExchangeC_01	You play in the woods all day. Do not scold me.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission1_Victory02_01	Nothing ever satisfies you, does it?
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission2_Intro02_01	I need to train against someone with skill.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission2_Turn01_Response_01	Exactly.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission2_Turn02_Response_01	I'm glad you noticed!
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission2_ExchangeA_02_01	I have one! To surpass my brother.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission2_ExchangeB_02_01	There may come a time when our foes demand we do not play safe.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission2_ExchangeC_01_01	The queen herself prefers the arcane arts.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission2_Victory02_01	Ouch.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission3_Intro01_01	The Burning Legion invaded Azeroth, but we formed a resistance force to fight back!
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission3_Intro03_01	I'll pass.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission3_Turn01_Response_01	Not this time! I can do it myself.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission3_Turn01_ResponseAlt_01	Not this time! After all, these are MY memories.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission3_Turn02_Intro_01	Leave this place!
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission3_ExchangeA_02_01	I can imagine a lot.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission3_ExchangeC_02_01	Me? Trust you? Hah.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission3_Victory_01	War is upon us, but now… I AM prepared! And preparation has its rewards.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission3_Loss_01	I can defeat him next time. The power is within me, I need only unleash it!
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Attack_01	None may challenge me!
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Greetings_01	Ishnu-alah.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Threaten_01	Are you provoking me?
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Picked_01	I will find my path.
	
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission1_Intro01_01	Spar against me, Illidan!
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission1_Turn01_Intro_01	You have such promise, yet you never study.
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission1_Turn02_Response_01	Cenarius is a demi-god. 
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission1_ExchangeA_01_01	Behold the power of nature!
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission1_ExchangeB_01_01	Cenarius has taught me much. 
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission1_Victory01_01	You have proved your talent, if not your discipline.
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission1_Loss_01	Keep practicing, brother. You will find your way.
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_TB_Hero_Malfurion_EmoteResponse_01	Yours is a… unique perspective.
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_TB_Hero_Malfurion_HeroPower_01_01	It shall be done.
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_TB_Hero_Malfurion_HeroPower_02_01	You test me.
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_TB_Hero_Malfurion_HeroPower_03_01	Nature's wrath upon you!
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Idle_01_01	A moment of meditation.
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Idle_02_01	Heed the wisdom in the winds.
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Idle_03_01	Cenarius is a mighty teacher. He could even make something of you.
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_RP_Mission3_Turn01_Intro_01	This demon is too strong. Let me aid you!
	
VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_RP_Mission2_Intro01_01	What brings you here?
VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_RP_Mission2_Turn01_Intro_01	A priestess of Elune is no easy foe.
VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_RP_Mission2_Turn02_Intro_01	Have you been working harder these days?
VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_RP_Mission2_ExchangeA_01_01	You need an ambition in life, Illidan.
VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_RP_Mission2_ExchangeB_01_01	I fear there's danger in using magic like yours.
VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_RP_Mission2_ExchangeC_02_01	Perhaps she has been misled.
VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_RP_Mission2_Victory01_01	Well done. If you keep practicing, you'll almost rival Malfurion!
VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_RP_Mission2_Loss_01	Apply yourself, and you will achieve great things. I truly believe that.
VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_TB_Hero_Tyrande_EmoteResponse_01	It is nice to chat with you, old friend.
VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_TB_Hero_Tyrande_HeroPower_01_01	By Elune.
VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_TB_Hero_Tyrande_HeroPower_02_01	As the goddess wills.
VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_TB_Hero_Tyrande_HeroPower_03_01	Share our strength.
VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Idle01_01	<_sigh_>
VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Idle02_01	Has anyone seen Ash'alah? 
VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Idle03_01	Training is vital for priestesses. Only a few different words between a blessing and a curse.
	
VO_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_Male_Demon_RP_Mission3_Intro02_01	Your world is the master's now. Surrender!
VO_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_Male_Demon_RP_Mission3_Turn02_Response_01	You do not command me.
VO_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_Male_Demon_RP_Mission3_ExchangeA_01_01	My master's power is beyond your imagining.
VO_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_Male_Demon_RP_Mission3_ExchangeB_01_01	You wield the arcane, but there is so much more.
VO_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_Male_Demon_RP_Mission3_ExchangeC_01_01	All you desire is within your reach. You need only stand down.
VO_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_Male_Demon_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_Death_01	<_death exertion_>
VO_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_Male_Demon_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_EmoteResponse_01	Words are weak.
VO_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_Male_Demon_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_HeroPower_01_01	Break before the Legion's tide!
VO_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_Male_Demon_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_HeroPower_02_01	Bow before the master!
VO_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_Male_Demon_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_HeroPower_03_01	Demons shall rule.
VO_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_Male_Demon_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_Idle_01_01	<_growl_>
VO_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_Male_Demon_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_Idle_02_01	Embrace defeat!
VO_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_Male_Demon_TB_ReturningPlayer_Houndmastr2_Idle_03_01	Make your move.

VO_Prologue_Azzinoth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Azzinoth_Death_01	<_death exertion_>
VO_Prologue_Azzinoth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Azzinoth_EmoteResponse_01	You are small and hard to understand.
VO_Prologue_Azzinoth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Azzinoth_HeroPower_01_01	I will cut away your arrogance!
VO_Prologue_Azzinoth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Azzinoth_HeroPower_02_01	Ah, my warglaives!
VO_Prologue_Azzinoth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Azzinoth_HeroPower_03_01	I wield the twin blades!
VO_Prologue_Azzinoth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Azzinoth_Idle_01_01	My weapons are legendary.
VO_Prologue_Azzinoth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Azzinoth_Idle_02_01	The master would swat you away like a fly.
VO_Prologue_Azzinoth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Azzinoth_Idle_03_01	You elves are fools to resist.
VO_Prologue_Azzinoth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mission1_ExchangeA_01_01	You lack the power to match your pride.
VO_Prologue_Azzinoth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mission1_ExchangeB_01_01	Do not deny it. You envy the might of demons.
VO_Prologue_Azzinoth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mission1_Intro_01_01	The Legion's forces have vanquished your allies! You are lost.
VO_Prologue_Azzinoth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mission1_Loss_01	We will obliterate your kind from the face of this world.
VO_Prologue_Azzinoth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mission1_Turn2_01	Every day, your resistance weakens. Your friends grow fewer.

VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission1_Intro05_01	Becoming a demon hunter meant leaving everything else behind. Yet, the memories linger. Would you hear them? For the story is often told, but not from my side…
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission1_Intro06_01	Thousands of years ago, I was just a mere sorcerer. Then, the demons came… We knew not why or how, only that we would resist.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission1_ExchangeA_02_01	Something I mean to remedy.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission1_ExchangeB_02_01	There is a certain appeal. Maybe.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission1_ExchangeC_02_01	You would fight by HIS side instead of mine.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission1_Illidan1_01	Those warglaives! I want them.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission1_Illidan2_01	A nice trick, indeed!
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission1_Illidan3_01	Such spells you have…
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission1_Intro_02_01	I enjoy a challenge.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission1_Turn1_02_01	I can handle it, brother.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission1_Victory_02_01	Azzinoth is dead, but the Legion will overwhelm us in time. We must find other ways to win, Malfurion.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_PreMission2_Intro04_01	As a mage, I relied on the Well of Eternity, controlled by Queen Azshara herself. I learned that she was behind the demons' invasion, condemning us all.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_PreMission2_Intro05_01	As a mage, I relied on the Well of Eternity, controlled by Queen Azshara herself. I learned that she was behind the demons' invasion, condemning us all. And for what? Power. Irresistible power… There was only one answer.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission2_ExchangeA_02_01	You control the Well. Without it, I am nothing.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission2_ExchangeB_02_01	My beloved prefers him. So, yes.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission2_ExchangeC_01_01	I hope your master is watching.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission2_Intro_02_01	I wish to join your side.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission2_Victory02_01	No, no, just your acceptance is reward enough!
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission2_Victory04_01	<_pained exertion_>
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission2_Victory05_01	My eyes! Yet… such things I can see now!
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_PreMission3_Intro03_01	I learned the ways of the demons and gained their trust. But when the time was right, I returned to my loathsome brother. I needed his power to help me close the portal forever.

VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission3_ExchangeB_02_01	Lies.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission3_ExchangeC_02_01	I've heard that one before.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission3_ExchangeD_02_01	It was always there. You never looked.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission3_Intro03_01	That was your master's mistake, not mine.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission3_Turn1_02_01	The things I do for victory.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission3_Turn2_01_01	I hardly even need your help, brother.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission3_Victory_01_01	The portal is imploding, taking the demons with it! Everything went as planned!
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_PreMission3_Intro01_01	I learned the ways of the demons, and gained their trust. But when the time was right…
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_PreMission3_Intro02_01	I returned to my loathsome brother. I needed his power to help me close the portal forever.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission4_ExchangeA_01	I saved all of you, and this is what I get in return!
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission4_ExchangeB_01	If you cannot see my bravery, see my anger!
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission4_ExchangeC_02_01	What I must be.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission4_Intro_02_01	Malfurion sent you instead of fighting me himself?! Coward.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission4_Turn1_02_01	No, you're not!
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission4_Victory01_01	Hah! I spit on your petty notions of justice! I make my own laws, my own path!
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission4_Victory02_01	At least, that's what should have happened…
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission4_Victory03_01	Instead, I was imprisoned in darkness for TEN. THOUSAND. YEARS.
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission4_Victory04_01	But I was still their savior… and the first of the demon hunters!
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_PreMission4_Intro_01_01	I secretly saved a vial from the Well of Eternity. You wouldn't understand. You aren't a mage!
VO_TB_Hero_Illidan2_Male_NightElf_Prologue_PreMission4_Intro_01ALT_01	I did what had to be done… but my own people feared what I had become. They came for me…

VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission1_Turn1_Intro_01_01	Those forests are overrun, Illidan!
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission1_Victory_01_01	What news, brother?
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission3_ExchangeD_01_01	I hardly know you anymore, Illidan. So much rage in your heart.
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission3_Turn1_01_01	Much has separated us, but now we fight as one.
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission3_Turn2_02_01	I wish that were true.
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission3_Victory_02_01	But you did not tell us all of your plan, brother…
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission4_Malfurion_01_01	Betrayer…
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission4_Malfurion_02_01	The bonds of kin are broken between us.
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission4_Malfurion_Shocked_at_Illidan_02_01	Demonic power courses through you, brother. What have you done?
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Prologue_Mission4_Turn1_01_01	I am sorry that it has come to this.
VO_TB_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Prologue_PreMission4_Intro_02_01	As long as it exists, we cannot be safe from the demons. You have gone too far, brother.

VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_Prologue_Mission1_ExchangeC_01_01	Malfurion and I are nearby if you need us.
VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_Prologue_Mission4_ExchangeC_01_01	Illidan, what have you become?
VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_Prologue_Mission4_Shocked_at_Illidan_01_01	What are these demonic weapons?
VO_TB_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_Prologue_Mission4_Shocked_at_Illidan_02_01	Illidan! You fight like they do! What are you!?

VO_Prologue_Sargeras_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mission2_Sargeras01_01	Yes…
VO_Prologue_Sargeras_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mission2_Sargeras02_01	Empower the portal…
VO_Prologue_Sargeras_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mission2_Victory03_01	You… are… the… one.

VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Mission2_DemonClawsAlt_01	I will grant you demon claws. Use them well.
VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Mission2_ExchangeA_01_01	Why abandon the resistance?
VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Mission2_ExchangeA_03_01	True.
VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Mission2_ExchangeB_01_01	You would betray your own brother?
VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Mission2_ExchangeC_02_01	Fear not. He is very close.
VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Mission2_ExchangeD_01	I used to be an elf like you. The master gave me many gifts.
VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Mission2_Intro_01_01	Why have you come to the palace, rebel?
VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Mission2_Intro_03_01	Prove yourself in combat, and I shall consider it.
VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Mission2_Loss_01	I knew you were unworthy of the master's attention.
VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Mission2_Turn2_01	Our portal is fragile. Strengthen it and earn the master's favor.
VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Mission2_Victory01_01	You have passed. Prepare to receive your just reward from the master.
VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Xavius_Death_01	Aaagh!
VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Xavius_EmoteResponse_01	Such cleverness! How unexpected.
VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Xavius_HeroPower_01_01	Serve the master.
VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Xavius_HeroPower_02_01	Obedience before all.
VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Xavius_HeroPower_03_01	For the glory of Queen Azshara!
VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Xavius_Idle_01_01	I am the High Councilor. It is my job to control entrance to the palace.
VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Xavius_Idle_02_01	The master spoke to me first. ME! Not you.
VO_Prologue_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Prologue_Xavius_Idle_03_01	If it weren't for this trouble with portals, the whole world would be conquered already.

VO_Prologue_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mannoroth_Death_01	Agh!
VO_Prologue_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mannoroth_EmoteResponse_01	The master will teach you fear.
VO_Prologue_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mannoroth_HeroPower_01_01	Useless rabble!
VO_Prologue_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mannoroth_HeroPower_02_01	Fall before me!
VO_Prologue_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mannoroth_HeroPower_03_01	None refuse Sargeras!
VO_Prologue_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mannoroth_Idle_01_01	If the fight fails, the drinks are on me.
VO_Prologue_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mannoroth_Idle_02_01	When Sargeras walks here, your kind will crawl like worms.
VO_Prologue_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mannoroth_Idle_03_01	Your destiny is to be forgotten.
VO_Prologue_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mission3_ExchangeA_01	The portal is almost complete! The master approaches!
VO_Prologue_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mission3_ExchangeB_01_01	A demon hunter cannot surpass a demon!
VO_Prologue_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mission3_ExchangeC_01_01	Your gifts are wasted on this!
VO_Prologue_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mission3_Intro01_01	Pitiful elf! You were never to be trusted.
VO_Prologue_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Prologue_Mission3_Loss_01	<_dark laughter_>

VO_Prologue_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Prologue_Cenarius_Death_01	<_death exertion_>
VO_Prologue_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Prologue_Cenarius_EmoteResponse_01	You do not speak for my trees.
VO_Prologue_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Prologue_Cenarius_HeroPower_01_01	Fight for the forests.
VO_Prologue_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Prologue_Cenarius_HeroPower_02_01	Growing strong!
VO_Prologue_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Prologue_Cenarius_HeroPower_03_01	Every tree and twig rises against you.
VO_Prologue_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Prologue_Cenarius_Idle_01_01	You have betrayed us all.
VO_Prologue_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Prologue_Cenarius_Idle_02_01	I always thought you might be a bad seed.
VO_Prologue_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Prologue_Cenarius_Idle_03_01	You should have listened to your brother. He has a fertile mind.
VO_Prologue_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Prologue_Cenarius_VictoryDenied_01	Illidan. Betrayer. You must pay for your crimes…
VO_Prologue_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Prologue_Mission4_Intro_01_01	Illidan! Answer for your crimes!
VO_Prologue_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Prologue_Mission4_Loss_01	Nature always triumphs.

VO_BTA_07_Male_Orc_Mission_Fight_08_Baduu_LeavesD_01	<i>It’s her choice.</i>

VO_BTA_BOSS_17h_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_08_VictoryA_01	<i>Who are these outcasts fleeing war?\nWhat brought them, desperate, to my door?</i>

VO_BTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_09_Hero_CoordinatedStrike_01	I thought this was a one-on-one…
VO_BTA_01_Female_NightElf_Mission_Fight_09_Hero_HeroPower_01	This feels so natural… like I was made to do it.
VO_BTA_01_Female_NightElf_Mission_Fight_09_Hero_HeroPower_02	I don’t want to hurt Shalja too badly.
VO_BTA_BOSS_09h_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_09_VictoryA_01	Well fought! I am... faster… stronger!
VO_BTA_01_Female_NightElf_Mission_Fight_09_VictoryB_01	<i>All my life, I’ve struggled to see.\nMy purpose, calling, why I’m me…</i>

VO_BTA_BOSS_10h_Male_Orc_Mission_Fight_10_Emote_Response_01	Yeah, I feel the same way. I think.
VO_BTA_BOSS_10h_Male_Orc_Mission_Fight_10_IdleA_01	This training… it has been worth it.
VO_BTA_BOSS_10h_Male_Orc_Mission_Fight_10_IdleB_01	I can feel something… raw and angry... inside of me.
VO_BTA_BOSS_10h_Male_Orc_Mission_Fight_10_IdleC_01	Outland is not what it once was.
VO_BTA_BOSS_10h_Male_Orc_Mission_Fight_10_HeroPower_01	This power… it is mine to command!

VO_BTA_BOSS_17h_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_10_Bonding_01A_01	Aranna. Your prowess in combat is impressive.
VO_BTA_01_Female_NightElf_Mission_Fight_10_Bonding_01B_01	I could never beat my sister. She was competitive in everything.
VO_BTA_BOSS_10h2_Male_Sporelok_Mission_Fight_10_Bonding_02A_01	Pffblatt?
VO_BTA_01_Female_NightElf_Mission_Fight_10_Bonding_02B_01	No Sklibb, it’s not a real fight. But try your best to win!
VO_BTA_BOSS_17h_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_10_Bonding_02C_01	You speak this one’s language? You are full of surprises.
VO_BTA_01_Female_NightElf_Mission_Fight_10_Bonding_02D_01	My sister took in a murloc and taught him to speak common.
VO_BTA_01_Female_NightElf_Mission_Fight_10_Bonding_02E_01	But I prefer to learn Sklibb’s language. It sounds a lot like… sneezing.
VO_BTA_01_Female_NightElf_Mission_Fight_10_Bonding_03A_01	Nice attack, Sklibb! Remember Illidan’s advice and keep moving.
VO_BTA_BOSS_17h_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_10_Bonding_03B_01	These outcasts respect you, Aranna. You’re a natural leader.
VO_BTA_01_Female_NightElf_Mission_Fight_10_Bonding_03C_01	I just… do what needs to be done.

VO_BTA_BOSS_17h_Male_NightElf_UI_Mission_Fight_11_Turn_1_Flavor_01	A rusted Arakkoa? This will be excellent training for you.
VO_BTA_BOSS_11h_Female_Arakkoa_Mission_Fight_11_BossStart_01	We will take this temple! For Jaraxxus!
VO_BTA_BOSS_11h_Female_Arakkoa_Mission_Fight_11_Emote_Response_01	Black Temple… Will fall!

VO_BTA_BOSS_17h_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_11_Bonding_04A_01	You talk about your sister often. I have an older brother.
VO_BTA_01_Female_NightElf_Mission_Fight_11_Bonding_04B_01	Everyone loves my sister. She was always “Miss Perfect.”
VO_BTA_BOSS_17h_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_11_Bonding_04C_01	I know EXACTLY how that feels.
VO_BTA_01_Female_NightElf_Mission_Fight_11_Bonding_05A_01	It’s like my sister could do no wrong. She was a druid.
VO_BTA_BOSS_17h_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_11_Bonding_05B_01	Druids! The WORST!
VO_BTA_BOSS_17h_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_11_Bonding_05C_01	I was jailed as a traitor for ten thousand years while my brother… TOOK A NAP.
VO_BTA_01_Female_NightElf_Mission_Fight_11_Bonding_06A_01	I’m sorry you don’t get along with your brother, Illidan.
VO_BTA_BOSS_17h_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_11_Bonding_06B_01	We are not our family, Aranna. We’re better. We do what needs to be done.
VO_BTA_01_Female_NightElf_Mission_Fight_11_VictoryA_01	That was just the first wave! Let's take down their leader!
VO_BTA_BOSS_17h_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_11_VictoryB_01	Go on ahead - consider this your final test!

VO_BTA_BOSS_17h_Male_NightElf_UI_Mission_Fight_12_CoinSelect_01	<i>It’s not yet done, keep your blades drawn.\nAnd face the beast: Magtheridon!</i>
VO_BTA_01_Female_NightElf_Mission_Fight_12_PlayerStart_01	Taking you down is my final test, beast.
VO_BTA_BOSS_12h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_12_BossStart_01	A test? I will remember that as I destroy you!
VO_BTA_BOSS_12h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_12_Emote_Response_01	Well, that's just PRIME!
VO_BTA_BOSS_12h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_12_Boss_Attack_01	<_Attack_>
VO_BTA_BOSS_12h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_12_IdleA_01	Jaraxxus gave me freedom. I will give him your head.
VO_BTA_BOSS_12h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_12_IdleB_01	What is Illidan TEACHING you kids?!
VO_BTA_BOSS_12h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_12_IdleC_01	This Temple will be YOUR prison!
VO_BTA_BOSS_12h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_12_HeroPowerTrigger_01	I'm in control of my blood now!
VO_BTA_BOSS_12h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_12_HeroPowerTrigger_02	Jaraxxus demands an army… he will get it.
VO_BTA_BOSS_12h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_12_HeroPowerTrigger_03	You have no chance against him!
VO_BTA_BOSS_12h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_12_HeroPowerTrigger_04	Illidan will PAY!
VO_BTA_BOSS_12h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_12_BossDeathA_01	<_Death_>

VO_BTA_BOSS_12h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_12_Boss_EndlessLegion_01	They are unending!
VO_BTA_BOSS_12h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_12_Boss_Crush_01	Squashed like a bug!
VO_BTA_BOSS_12h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_12_Boss_BloodWarriors_01	From my blood… rust!
VO_BTA_BOSS_12h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_12_Hero_Magtheridon_01	This is a trick! This is sorcery! I am the real Magtheridon!
VO_BTA_BOSS_12h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_12_Hero_ChaosNova_01	Wait… that's my move!
VO_BTA_BOSS_12h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_12_Hero_EyeBeam_01	Eye beams? I need an upgrade…
VO_BTA_08_Male_Orc_Mission_Fight_12_MiscA_01	This beast… his blood corrupted my people…
VO_BTA_BOSS_12h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_12_MiscB_01	And who do you think did that, Orc?!
VO_BTA_01_Female_NightElf_Mission_Fight_12_VictoryA_01	<i>I'm blind but now I see the dawn-\nMy potential. The hunt is on!</i>

VO_BTA_BOSS_17h_Male_NightElf_UI_Mission_Fight_13_CoinSelect_01	<i>A rusted ogre, Legion-bred.\nNow face him head-to-head. (To-head.)</i>
VO_BTA_01_Female_NightElf_Mission_Fight_13_PlayerStart_01	Let's show the Rusted Legion how real Demon Hunters fight!
VO_BTA_BOSS_13h_Male_Ogre_Mission_Fight_13_BossStart_01	Wha? Who are you?
VO_BTA_BOSS_13h_Male_Ogre_Mission_Fight_13_BossStart_02	It's those Demon Hunters, you fool!
VO_BTA_BOSS_13h_Male_Ogre_Mission_Fight_13_Emote_Response_01	Get outta here! This our house!

VO_BTA_10_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_13_Misc_01	I wonder what a shock to that metal head of theirs would do…
VO_BTA_08_Male_Orc_Mission_Fight_13_Misc_02	Their incessant arguing is… tiresome.
VO_BTA_08_Male_Orc_Mission_Fight_13_VictoryA_01	Jaraxxus is close… I can sense him.
VO_BTA_10_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_13_VictoryB_01	All of these demons around… how can you be so sure?

VO_BTA_BOSS_17h_Male_NightElf_UI_Mission_Fight_14_CoinSelect_01	<i>What is this tiny, worthless foe?\nDestroy it! End this weak sideshow.</i>
VO_BTA_01_Female_NightElf_Mission_Fight_14_PlayerStart_01	This is the last line of defense before Jaraxxus? Trivial…

VO_BTA_BOSS_19h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_19_Hero_Magtheridon_01	A hallucination! Am I really free at all?!
VO_BTA_BOSS_19h_Male_Demon_Mission_Fight_19_Hero_Warden_01	Bahaha! Your shackles will not contain me, Warden!

VO_BTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Gronn_Mission_Fight_20_BossStart_01	Beg for life!
VO_BTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Gronn_Mission_Fight_20_Emote_Response_01	Ha-hrm. DISAGREE.
VO_BTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Gronn_Mission_Fight_20_Boss_Attack_01	No more.
VO_BTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Gronn_Mission_Fight_20_IdleA_01	Just want to be left alone…
VO_BTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Gronn_Mission_Fight_20_IdleB_01	Make a gronn angry, get crushed.
VO_BTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Gronn_Mission_Fight_20_IdleC_01	Wish I was there to kill the big, BIG dragon.
VO_BTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Gronn_Mission_Fight_20_HeroPower_01	No escape.
VO_BTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Gronn_Mission_Fight_20_HeroPower_02	Unworthy!
VO_BTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Gronn_Mission_Fight_20_HeroPower_03	Away from here.
VO_BTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Gronn_Mission_Fight_20_HeroPower_04	Leave Gruul alone.

VO_BTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Gronn_Mission_Fight_20_Bladestorm_01	Slay!

VO_BTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Gronn_Mission_Fight_20_Hero_Dragon_01	Dragons did not learn their lesson?!
VO_BTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Gronn_Mission_Fight_20_Hero_Khadgar_01	Magic man is back?
VO_BTA_BOSS_20h_Male_Gronn_Mission_FighT_20_Hero_Gruul_01	Purple Gruul… not Gruul!  I am Gruul!

VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_UI_Mission_Fight_22_CoinSelect_01	I was the first, you know. For me, the wheel of death has spun many times.
VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_Mission_Fight_22_BossStart_01	Vengeance is mine!
VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_Mission_Fight_22_BossStartIllidan_01	Come to betray me, Illidan?
VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_Mission_Fight_22_Emote_Response_01	You will show the proper respect!
VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_Mission_Fight_22_Boss_Attack_01	<_Attack_>
VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_Mission_Fight_22_IdleA_01	So much time has passed... I have a lot of catching up to do.
VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_Mission_Fight_22_IdleB_01	This human body is so… small.
VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_Mission_Fight_22_IdleC_01	It is SO good to be back. Those foolish adventurers…
VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_Mission_Fight_22_HeroPower_01	I have something for you…
VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_Mission_Fight_22_HeroPower_02	What are you afraid of?
VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_Mission_Fight_22_HeroPower_03	Don't look behind you…
VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_Mission_Fight_22_HeroPower_04	It gets worse…
VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_Mission_Fight_22_BossDeath_01	<_Death_>
VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_Mission_Fight_22_BossDeathAlt_01	Death… isn't so bad…
VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_Mission_Fight_22_Boss_DeathGrip_01	I have use for this one…
VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_Mission_Fight_22_Boss_DeathandDecay_01	We're all rotting here…
VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_Mission_Fight_22_Boss_SiphonSoul_01	What's a soul for a few more years of life?
VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_Mission_Fight_22_Hero_LichKing_01	Oh, hello, Arthas. I've heard much about you.
VO_BTA_BOSS_22h_Male_Human_Mission_Fight_22_Hero_DeathKnightHero_01	My goodness, Death Knights sure have changed…

VO_BTA_BOSS_08hx_Female_Demon_UI_Mission_Fight_23_CoinSelect_01	Care to dance?
VO_BTA_BOSS_08hx_Female_Demon_Mission_Fight_23_BossStart_01	I'm hoping for a real challenge this time.
VO_BTA_BOSS_08hx_Female_Demon_Mission_Fight_23_BossStartDemonHunter_01	Here for a sparring match, Demon Hunter?
VO_BTA_BOSS_08hx_Female_Demon_Mission_Fight_23_Emote_Response_01	Oh, that's cute.
VO_BTA_BOSS_08hx_Female_Demon_Mission_Fight_23_Boss_Attack_01	<_Attack_>
VO_BTA_BOSS_08hx_Female_Demon_Mission_Fight_23_IdleA_01	Stop toying with me, my swords itch.
VO_BTA_BOSS_08hx_Female_Demon_Mission_Fight_23_IdleB_01	Are we having fun? I'm not so sure.
VO_BTA_BOSS_08hx_Female_Demon_Mission_Fight_23_IdleC_01	You seem a little tense. Relax, it's all in good fun.
VO_BTA_BOSS_08hx_Female_Demon_Mission_Fight_23_HeroPower_01	Ha! Nice try!
VO_BTA_BOSS_08hx_Female_Demon_Mission_Fight_23_HeroPower_02	That was a mistake.
VO_BTA_BOSS_08hx_Female_Demon_Mission_Fight_23_HeroPower_03	You'll have to do better.
VO_BTA_BOSS_08hx_Female_Demon_Mission_Fight_23_HeroPower_04	I'm not impressed.
VO_BTA_BOSS_08hx_Female_Demon_Mission_Fight_23_BossDeath_01	<_Death_>
VO_BTA_BOSS_08hx_Female_Demon_Mission_Fight_23_Hero_LightsChampion_01	That's… oddly specific.
VO_BTA_BOSS_08hx_Female_Demon_Mission_Fight_23_Hero_StolenSteel_01	It's OK, I've got plenty of swords…
VO_BTA_BOSS_08hx_Female_Demon_Mission_Fight_23_Hero_Bladestorm_01	I like your style.

VO_BTA_BOSS_24h_Female_Naga_UI_Mission_Fight_24_CoinSelect_01	We are the Highborne, and the time has come at last for us to retake our rightful place in the world!
VO_BTA_BOSS_24h_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_24_BossStart_01	I did not wish to lower myself by engaging your kind, but you leave me little choice...
VO_BTA_BOSS_24h_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_24_BossStartIllidan_01	Lord Illidan! Why have you turned against me?
VO_BTA_BOSS_24h_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_24_Emote_Response_01	Did you not hear me? I am Highborne. Begone.
VO_BTA_BOSS_24h_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_24_Boss_Attack_01	Straight to the heart!
VO_BTA_BOSS_24h_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_24_Boss_AttackALT_01	<_Attack_>
VO_BTA_BOSS_24h_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_24_IdleA_01	We alone shall control the water in Outland, surface filth!
VO_BTA_BOSS_24h_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_24_IdleB_01	I conquered Outland. What have you accomplished?
VO_BTA_BOSS_24h_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_24_IdleC_01	No, you may not feed my hair…
VO_BTA_BOSS_24h_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_24_HeroPower_01	Leave none standing!
VO_BTA_BOSS_24h_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_24_HeroPower_02	In Azshara's name!
VO_BTA_BOSS_24h_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_24_HeroPower_03	You may want to take cover.
VO_BTA_BOSS_24h_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_24_HeroPower_04	Your time ends now!

VO_BTA_BOSS_24h_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_24_Boss_DeadlyShot_01	Seek your mark!
VO_BTA_BOSS_24h_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_24_Boss_BowEquip_01	Taste my sting….
VO_BTA_BOSS_24h_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_24_Boss_CoilfangWarlord_01	Show them your might!
VO_BTA_BOSS_24h_Female_Naga_Mission_Fight_24_Hero_LadyVashj_01	Is that my reflection in the water? I look… wonderful!


VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_UI_Mission_Fight_25_CoinSelect_01	Energy. Power. My people are addicted to it... a dependence made manifest after the Sunwell was destroyed.
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_BossStart_01	No one can stop me now! Selama ashal'anore!
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_BossStartJaina_01	Ah, Jaina. How did we come to this?
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_BossStartIllidan_01	Illidan!? Indeed, you ARE the betrayer!
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_BossStartArthas_01	Prince Arthas. We have unfinished business.
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_BossStartLiadrin_01	Liadrin! It is not too late for us to work together!
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_Emote_Response_01	I'm the one who gives the speeches around here!
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_Boss_Attack_01	<_Attack_>
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_IdleA_01	I've waited for my revenge. I will continue waiting.
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_IdleB_01	A reprieve, then? Granted. Ahaha.
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_IdleC_01	I never do tire of making speeches. Would you like to hear about the Sunwell again?
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_HeroPower_01	Now, you will taste true power!
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_HeroPower_02	Fire consume you!
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_HeroPower_03	None spare the flame!
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_HeroPower_04	Know my fury!
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_BossDeath_01	For... Quel'...Thalas!
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_BossDeathALT_01	<_Death_>
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_Boss_GravityLapse_01	Your world is upside down!
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_Boss_GravityLapse_02	Having trouble staying grounded?
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_Boss_Alar_01	By the power of the Sun!
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_Boss_Flamestrike_01	Felo'melorn!
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_Boss_VaporizeTrigger_01	A pitiful attempt. To be expected.
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_Hero_LichKing_01	Arthas… you took everything from me. I will destroy you!
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_Hero_FrostSpell_01	Frost? I… hate… frost.
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_Hero_CounterSpell_01	You can't just… counter my spells. That isn't fair!
VO_BTA_BOSS_25h_Male_BloodElf_Mission_Fight_25_Hero_Treant_01	A forest..? To fight a fire mage? Ha!

VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_UI_Mission_Fight_26_CoinSelect_01	So you've come for me. Very well.
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_BossStart_01	My hatred is unending. I will make short work of you.
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_BossStartMaiev_01	Make no mistake Maiev, I will not be shackled again.
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_BossStartArthas_01	Arthas… a rematch, then.
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_Emote_Response_01	It is too late for bargaining.
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_Boss_Attack_01	<_Attack_>
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_IdleA_01	I have waited ten thousand years. What's a few more seconds?
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_IdleB_01	My blades need sharpening…
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_IdleC_01	You have wasted much of my time, mortal.
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_HeroPower_01	Behold the flames of Azzinoth!
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_HeroPower_02	Burn! As my hatred does!
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_HeroPower_03	This is too easy!
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_HeroPower_04	Who will be next to taste my blades?
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_BossDeath_01	<_Death_>
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_Boss_Metamorphosis_01	Now I am complete!
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_Boss_SpectralSight_01	Stare into the eyes of the Betrayer!
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_Boss_ChaosNova_01	Behold the power… of the demon within!
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_Boss_SkullofGuldan_01	Alas, Gul'dan… your power is mine.
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_Boss_InnerDemon_01	Feel the hatred of ten thousand years!
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_Boss_YouAreNotPrepared_01	You are not prepared!
VO_BTA_BOSS_17hx_Male_NightElf_Mission_Fight_26_Hero_Akama_01	I should have slaughtered you and your malformed brethren long ago.

VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission1_01	All things change. That is what magic is—transformation, creation… destruction.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission1_02	But, despite my command of it, I never realized how much change would affect me—the things I believed in… and the things I stood for.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission1_03	I was raised in Kul Tiras, but as my talent for magic grew, I wanted to study under Archmage Antonidas in Dalaran. 
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission1Intro_01	Take me on as your apprentice, please!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission1ExchangeA_01	I'll prove myself to you!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission1ExchangeB_01	Even my father is impressed by this one! And he never smiles at anything.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission1ExchangeC_01	But I want it to be you! You're the best!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission1ExchangeD_01	No, not him. He gives me the creeps.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission1Victory_01	Really? Oh, thank you!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Threaten_01	Why are you being so difficult?
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Error_Hand_Full_01	I don't have space.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission2_01	Antonidas was a kind and skillful teacher. My advancement grew beyond my wildest dreams, but so did the pressure I faced.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission2_02	I spent my days with mages who were older and more powerful than I. There was bound to be some awkwardness…
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission2Intro_01	Certainly, Your Highness.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission2ExchangeA_01	Oh, all right.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission2ExchangeB_01	Let's… not talk about that.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission2ExchangeC_01	I'm just trying not to burn any more literature.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission2Victory_01	I appreciate it, but my place is here in Dalaran for now.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission3_01	I couldn't tell Kael'thas that there was another prince I loved—Arthas. We'd just reunited when a plague broke out across the lands of Lordaeron. 
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission3_02	We worked together to investigate. But the further we went, the clearer it became that I was losing him.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission3Intro_01	I'm worried about you, Arthas. You haven't been yourself lately.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission3ExchangeA_01	I'm not accusing you of anything! There's no need to attack me.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission3ExchangeB_01	You're a man of faith. You don't have to hate the enemy so fiercely…
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission3ExchangeC_01	Uther cares about you… so do I.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission3ExchangeD_01	I know. But this plague might not be something you can resolve with force.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission3Victory_01	If you say so.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission4_01	The darkness I sensed within Arthas was the work of demons. They twisted his soul, transforming him into the Lich King…
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission4_02	And he did their bidding—terrorizing his former kingdom. Antonidas charged me with evacuating civilians across the sea.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission4_03	But even there, the demons' influence was lurking, strong as ever.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission4Intro_01	Never! How did you orcs even get here?
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission4ExchangeA_01	You escaped the internment camps?
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission4ExchangeB_01	Dark magic lingers around you… you've been corrupted.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission4ExchangeC_01	Then we need to subdue him… Let's work together.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission4Victory_01	Perhaps if we join forces, we can undo more of the demons' plans.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission5_01	I was right. Destiny had brought us together just in time to face a mighty demon: Archimonde.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission5_02	The night elves united with us as the demon moved to corrupt their World Tree.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission5_03	This was our one chance to lay a trap for him… and ensure his destruction.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission5Intro_01	Indeed. But the reckoning will be yours.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission5ExchangeA_01	Is talking all you demons do?
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission5ExchangeB_01	Hm, he doesn't suspect anything.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission5Victory_01	Everything we hoped for came true. Archimonde didn't see the trap until it was too late.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission6_01	Our Alliance with the night elves held firm, but the Horde followed another path. 
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission6_02	Despite the challenges, including my own father's attempts at war, I stood by Thrall and upheld the fragile peace.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission6_03	Then he stepped down as leader of the Horde. In his place was… a monster. The first chance he had, he attacked us.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission6Intro_01	Our people have lived in peace for many years. We had an agreement with the Warchief! 
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission6ExchangeA_01	I won't be the aggressor in this!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission6ExchangeB_01	I trusted Thrall. Why would you throw that away?
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission6ExchangeC_01	I used to believe in peace, but no more. Now I know what they are truly capable of.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission6GatesAttacked_01	Reinforce our gates!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission6GatesAttacked_02	The gates are crumbling!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission6GatesGone_01	Our gates are gone…
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission6Victory_01	I can't leave my people!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission7_01	I was defeated, but not helpless. I found a way to avenge the fallen… a spell that could summon enough power to destroy all of Orgrimmar.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission7_02	Only one person could stand in my way.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission7Intro_01	Friend?! This is all your fault, Thrall…
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission7ExchangeA_01	Your Warchief annihilated Theramore! Nothing remains!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission7ExchangeB_01	The Horde is made of monsters, Thrall. You alone deceived me.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission7ExchangeC_01	You can't understand it. You weren't there. You didn't see what happened to Theramore… to me.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission7Victory_01	I… I won't let them get away with this.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission7Victory_02	Fine. So long as he knows he will never again be my ally.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission8_01	Kalec stayed my hand that day, however, it was only a matter of time until the Horde betrayed me again.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_PreMission8_02	I became the leader of the Kirin Tor, and, as such, was authorized to expel them from the city of Dalaran. Permanently.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission8Intro_01	You've betrayed the Kirin Tor, Sunreaver. Your kind is no longer welcome here.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission8ExchangeA_01	Hah! I see. I will remove you by force, then.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission8ExchangeB_01	No, I have finally accepted the truth.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission8ExchangeC_01	Not when you stab me in the back!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission8ExchangeD_01	You aided Garrosh, and I will never forgive you for that.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission8Victory_01	At last, I was free of the Horde and the burden of supporting an impossible peace.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission8Victory_02	There were times I still dreamed of the ideals I held in the past, but that time has gone forever.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Human_Female_Story_Jaina_Mission8Victory_03	Now I have changed into the person the world needs me to be—one who leads with conviction, not appeasement—in the face of endless war. 
	
VO_Story_Hero_Antonidas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission1Intro_01	I'm afraid I don't have time for that.
VO_Story_Hero_Antonidas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission1ExchangeB_01	You are quite good.
VO_Story_Hero_Antonidas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission1ExchangeC_01	There are plenty of fine mages here who could help you.
VO_Story_Hero_Antonidas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission1ExchangeC_02	I suppose that's right…
VO_Story_Hero_Antonidas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission1ExchangeD_01	You could ask Archmage Kel'Thuzad for instruction.
VO_Story_Hero_Antonidas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission1Victory_01	All right, Miss Jaina. You have won me over. I could not imagine a better candidate for my apprentice.
VO_Story_Hero_Antonidas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission1HeroPower_01	Here's some advanced material…
VO_Story_Hero_Antonidas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission1HeroPower_02	You have a lot to learn.
VO_Story_Hero_Antonidas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission1HeroPower_03	Ahah!
VO_Story_Hero_Antonidas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission1Loss_01	Forgive me, Miss Jaina. I'm certain you'll become a wonderful mage in time.
VO_Story_Hero_Antonidas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission1Idle_01	My work with the Kirin Tor keeps me quite busy.
VO_Story_Hero_Antonidas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission1Idle_02	We are at war with the orc invaders. It takes much of my attention.
VO_Story_Hero_Antonidas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission1Idle_03	I do sense there is something special about you, Miss Jaina.
VO_Story_Hero_Antonidas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission1EmoteResponse_01	Let's focus on the matter at hand.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission2Intro_01	May I have a demonstration of your studies, Lady Proudmoore? 
VO_Story_Hero_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission2ExchangeA_01	You can call me Kael.
VO_Story_Hero_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission2ExchangeB_01	I remember when you were accidentally setting books on fire!
VO_Story_Hero_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission2ExchangeC_01	I see you still favor ice spells. It is fire that calls to me!
VO_Story_Hero_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission2ExchangeC_02	Haha, that's fair.
VO_Story_Hero_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission2Victory_01	Your progress is brilliant, Jaina. Please visit Silvermoon with me sometime.
VO_Story_Hero_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission1EmoteResponse_01	What a charming thought.
VO_Story_Hero_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission2HeroPower_01	Just a small trick!
VO_Story_Hero_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission2HeroPower_02	Are you impressed?
VO_Story_Hero_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission2HeroPower_03	Watch this!
VO_Story_Hero_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission2Loss_01	A pity it turned out this way. I'd heard such wonderful things about you.
VO_Story_Hero_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission2Idle_01	Being a prince is a great burden, but someone must bear it.
VO_Story_Hero_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission2Idle_02	My homeland is beautiful beyond measure, yet it would be even lovelier with you.
VO_Story_Hero_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission2Idle_03	It's so delightful when humans aren't intimidated by me!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission3Intro_01	Don't you think I have enough on my mind without your accusations?!
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission3ExchangeA_01	You started this. We'll settle it by sparring.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission3ExchangeB_01	You sound like Uther.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission3ExchangeD_01	I will fight for my kingdom. People expect that from me.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission3Victory_01	I'm sorry. When this is all over, everything will be fine again. I promise.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission3EmoteResponse_01	That won't work on me this time.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission3HeroPower_01	Try to see it my way.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission3HeroPower_02	I'm under a lot of pressure!
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission3HeroPower_03	No one understands!
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission3Loss_01	Part of me knows you're right… I just don't know what else to do.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission3Idle_01	I hate arguing like this.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission3Idle_02	We have to get along, Jaina. Our future together depends on it.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Jaina_Mission3Idle_03	This plague is the worst thing I've ever seen. Lordaeron is on the verge of ruin.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission4Intro_01	Leave these lands, pinkskin!
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission4Intro_02	We are always one step ahead.
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission4ExchangeA_01	There is no cage that can yet hold me.
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission4ExchangeB_01	Silence, human!
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission4Victory_01	I see clearly now. I'm... sorry. I am so sorry.
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission4EmoteResponse_01	BAH!
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission4HeroPower_01	Where is Gorehowl?!
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission4HeroPower_02	Aaaaaa!
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission4HeroPower_03	Taste my blade!
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission4Loss_01	What has come over me? I did not mean to do that…
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission4Idle_01	None can rival the power the demons have given us!
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission4Idle_02	The blood haze clouds everything…
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission4Idle_03	I left behind my home… my ailing son… all for the glory of battle!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission4ExchangeC_01	I am Thrall, leader of the orc Horde. This warrior answers to me, but his mind has been overwhelmed by rage.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission4ThrallHelp_01	I will aid you.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission4ThrallHelp_02	Here is more help.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission4ThrallHelp_03	Let me assist.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission4Victory_01	All is well, thanks to Lady Proudmoore.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission5Thrall_01	Fight on, my warriors! They cannot stop the Horde!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission5Victory_01	Our spirit is stronger than he ever knew.
VO_Story_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_Story_Jaina_Mission5Tyrande_01	For Elune!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission7Intro_01	The elements called me here to stop you, old friend…
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission7ExchangeA_01	I grieve for your city. But vengeance will not bring back what was lost.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission7ExchangeB_01	Fight Garrosh. But the rest of my people are not your enemy.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission7EmoteResponse_01	We can talk through this.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission7Loss_01	Jaina… I never wanted this. I am so sorry.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission7HeroPower_01	Blood and thunder!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission7HeroPower_02	Elements guide me!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission7HeroPower_03	Storm, earth, and fire—heed my call!	
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission7Idle_01	Do not be blinded by your grief. Much more is at stake.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission7Idle_02	I made a grave error in trusting Garrosh…
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission7Idle_03	I thought you hated resorting to violence?!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission6Intro_01	There is a new warchief.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission6ExchangeA_01	Then accept the consequences.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission6ExchangeB_01	It doesn't matter now.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission6Victory_01	And now, deploy our final weapon!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission6EmoteResponse_01	You cannot change what must be done.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission6HeroPower_01	Theramore will fall!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission6HeroPower_02	I will crush you!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission6HeroPower_03	Victory or death!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission6Loss_01	Under my leadership, the Horde will conquer all!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission6Idle_01	You have never seen the true Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission6Idle_02	Your father attacked us, and you will as well!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Jaina_Mission6Idle_03	Thrall sat at your feet like a dog. I will not!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Archimonde_Male_Demon_Story_Jaina_Mission5Intro_01	The time for reckoning has come!
VO_Story_Hero_Archimonde_Male_Demon_Story_Jaina_Mission5ExchangeA_01	You are very brave to stand against me.
VO_Story_Hero_Archimonde_Male_Demon_Story_Jaina_Mission5ExchangeA_02	If only your countrymen had been as bold, I would have had more fun scouring you from the world!
VO_Story_Hero_Archimonde_Male_Demon_Story_Jaina_Mission5ExchangeB_01	If I'd known that this mortal resistance would be so weak, I would have launched this invasion centuries ago!
VO_Story_Hero_Archimonde_Male_Demon_Story_Jaina_Mission5Death_01	<_death exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_Archimonde_Male_Demon_Story_Jaina_Mission5EmoteResponse_01	Pathetic mortal! 
VO_Story_Hero_Archimonde_Male_Demon_Story_Jaina_Mission5HeroPower_01	Your resistance is insignificant!
VO_Story_Hero_Archimonde_Male_Demon_Story_Jaina_Mission5HeroPower_02	All creation will be devoured!
VO_Story_Hero_Archimonde_Male_Demon_Story_Jaina_Mission5HeroPower_03	This world will burn!
VO_Story_Hero_Archimonde_Male_Demon_Story_Jaina_Mission5Loss_01	Soon the heart of your world will beat no more…
VO_Story_Hero_Archimonde_Male_Demon_Story_Jaina_Mission5Idle_01	You are nothing in the face of my power.
VO_Story_Hero_Archimonde_Male_Demon_Story_Jaina_Mission5Idle_02	Mourn the passing of all you have ever known.
VO_Story_Hero_Archimonde_Male_Demon_Story_Jaina_Mission5Idle_03	All of your efforts have been in vain.
	
VO_Story_Minion_Kalec_Male_Dragon_Story_Jaina_Mission6ExchangeC_01	They will stop at nothing…
VO_Story_Minion_Kalec_Male_Dragon_Story_Jaina_Mission6Victory_01	You must retreat, Jaina. Save yourself!
VO_Story_Minion_Kalec_Male_Dragon_Story_Jaina_Mission6Victory_02	You won't achieve anything by dying here.
VO_Story_Minion_Kalec_Male_Dragon_Story_Jaina_Mission7Victory_01	This is not who you are, Jaina. You can deal with the Horde another way!
VO_Story_Minion_Kalec_Male_Dragon_Story_Jaina_Mission7Victory_02	Of course not. But let Thrall go.
	
VO_Story_01_Aethas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission8Intro_01	This is OUR city too, Proudmoore.
VO_Story_01_Aethas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission8ExchangeB_01	You are mad.
VO_Story_01_Aethas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission8ExchangeC_01	The Kirin Tor is beyond the Alliance or Horde.
VO_Story_01_Aethas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission8ExchangeD_01	Honestly, I don't even know what you're talking about.
VO_Story_01_Aethas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission8Death_01	<_death exertion_>
VO_Story_01_Aethas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission8EmoteResponse_01	What do you mean?
VO_Story_01_Aethas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission8HeroPower_01	Diel fin'al!
VO_Story_01_Aethas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission8HeroPower_02	Time to light a fire!
VO_Story_01_Aethas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission8HeroPower_03	Anar'alah belore!
VO_Story_01_Aethas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission8Loss_01	I suppose now I have betrayed you… unfortunately.
VO_Story_01_Aethas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission8Idle_01	Please come to your senses, Archmage!
VO_Story_01_Aethas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission8Idle_02	I don't know who turned on you, but it wasn't me.
VO_Story_01_Aethas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Jaina_Mission8Idle_03	The Sunreavers have always served the Kirin Tor honorably.

VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission1_01	I have wandered a long way… across worlds and wars… bonds forged and broken. 
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission1_02	There is much to learn from this journey, if you have the strength to follow it.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission1_03	I was born on Draenor. As war broke out around us, my people, the mok'nathal, remained peaceful. And unprepared.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1Intro_01	The rise of the Horde changes everything. We must take a side!
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1ExchangeB_01	The Horde is mighty. They could crush us at any moment, just like they crushed the draenei.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1ExchangeC_01	Still, we must try.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1ExchangeD_01	Our clan is too small. Our allies too few.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1Victory_01	I have proved my point!
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Greetings_01	Greetings.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Attack_01	I don't want to do this… But I will.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Threaten_01	If only your wisdom were as great as your temper.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission2_01	I was banished from my only home. Unable to convince my clan to act, I would have to confront the Horde by myself.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission2_02	Should they listen, my loss would not be in vain.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission2Intro_01	Warchief Blackhand! May I have a word?
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission2Intro_02	Then we fight.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission2ExchangeA_01	Yes. It is on their behalf I come to you.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission2ExchangeB_01	You must spare them!
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission2ExchangeC_01	I know you have. But my people could not endure that.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission2Victory_01	I swear it.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission3_01	Fighting for the Horde took me through the Dark Portal to the distant world of Azeroth.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission3_02	I knew nothing of the people there, only that the Warchief wished them gone. But even he fell, in time.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission3_03	After two of their wars, I had no more taste for it. My only solace was in the wilds. 
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission3Intro_01	What a magnificent beast!
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission3Intro_02	I will tame you, though it may take some time.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission3ExchangeA_01	You are the first "civilized" being I've met for a long while.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission3ExchangeB_01	You fight because you are scared. I am the same.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission3ExchangeC_01	We ought to be friends. I have no others.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission3ExchangeD_01	Easy, now…
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission3ExchangeE_01	Whoa there!
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission3Victory_01	I knew you'd come around. I will look after you now. Neither of us has to be alone anymore.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission4_01	I left the Horde. With Misha at my side, we journeyed through the Kalimdor wilds.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission4_02	I was careful to always avoid the cities. Until one day, I had no choice…
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission4Intro_01	What is that commotion? A battle?
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission4Intro_02	Hold fast, stranger! You shall not stand alone!
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission4ExchangeA_01	You are badly hurt. Let me handle the rest of them!
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission4ExchangeB_01	I can do little to ease your pain.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission4ExchangeB_02	Failure?
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission4ExchangeC_01	I will deliver your message. Your honor is not lost.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission4ExchangeC_02	May the winds bear you swiftly to your ancestors, warrior.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission4Victory_01	A message for you, Warchief. Mogrin entrusted me with it before he passed.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission4Victory_02	Only if you'll let me carry my own weight.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission5_01	The new Warchief had many problems. He'd made a pact with a human, Jaina, yet still our camps were raided.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission5_02	Jaina claimed she had not given that order. Together, we went to find our true enemy.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission5Intro_01	The naga destroyed our camp!
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission5ExchangeB_01	Thrall does. That should be enough.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission5ExchangeC_01	Peace is always fragile.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission5ExchangeD_01	That is why we clash.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission5ExchangeE_01	What do you mean?
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission5Victory_01	The naga are gone. But who were the humans attacking us?
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission6_01	Thanks to Jaina, I escaped. But war was upon us and worse, we were outnumbered.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission6_02	Warchief Thrall knew we needed allies. He sent me to rescue a young tauren from the centaur, hoping it could win his people to our side.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission6Intro_01	You kidnapped Baine Bloodhoof and devastated his father. Release him, now!
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission6ExchangeA_01	I promise to, Baine.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission6ExchangeB_01	Wild things do not belong in cages.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission6ExchangeC_01	Shut up.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission6Victory_01	Baine! Are you all right?
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission7_01	Baine was true to his word. His father, Chieftain Cairne, pledged his warriors to our cause.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission7_02	We were ready to face Admiral Proudmoore… and all of his old hatreds.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission7Intro_01	But some things cannot be undone.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission7ExchangeC_01	Lok'tar Ogar! For the Horde! For Durotar!
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission7Victory_01	I belong in the wilds, amidst the beasts and elements of the land. But I will always be there when you need me, brother. 
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission8_01	As time passed, my heart longed for my homeland. With the Dark Portal restored, I was free to return.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission8_02	When I finally found my people, it was just as I feared. They were under attack by the Bloodmaul ogres and their leader—a giant gronn. 
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_PreMission8_03	I would use all my years of fighting to save them.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission8Intro_01	I am Rexxar, Champion of the Horde. Son of the mok'nathal.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission8ExchangeA_01	There is no reasoning with a creature like this.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission8ExchangeB_01	It is like fighting a mountain itself…
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission8ExchangeC_01	I am many things.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission8Victory_01	After the giant fell, my banishment was at an end. My people welcomed me… all but my father. Yet, I will give him time.
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission8Victory_02	Over the years, I have learned that nothing is more important than the journey we all take in our hearts. 
VO_Story_Hero_Rexxar_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission8Victory_03	So long as we are wild and free, we will find our way.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Leoroxx_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1Intro_01	Trust in our ways. They have always served us well.
VO_Story_Hero_Leoroxx_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1ExchangeA_01	My own son speaks like this?! I will teach you a lesson.
VO_Story_Hero_Leoroxx_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1ExchangeB_01	Not if we are quiet.
VO_Story_Hero_Leoroxx_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1ExchangeC_01	We are half-ogre, half-orc. Outsiders will never accept us.
VO_Story_Hero_Leoroxx_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1ExchangeD_01	The mountains hide us. That is protection enough!
VO_Story_Hero_Leoroxx_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1ExchangeE_01	You think like they do. That is not how you were raised.
VO_Story_Hero_Leoroxx_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1Victory_01	You have proved you do not belong here. Leave me.
VO_Story_Hero_Leoroxx_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1EmoteResponse_01	You would do best not to speak.
VO_Story_Hero_Leoroxx_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1HeroPower_01	Listen to me!
VO_Story_Hero_Leoroxx_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1HeroPower_02	Heed my words.
VO_Story_Hero_Leoroxx_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1HeroPower_03	I know better!
VO_Story_Hero_Leoroxx_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1Loss_01	A father's wisdom may be hard, but it is fair.
VO_Story_Hero_Leoroxx_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1Idle_01	Trust in peace. There is no safer course.
VO_Story_Hero_Leoroxx_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1Idle_02	I fear you are going down a dark path, my son.
VO_Story_Hero_Leoroxx_Male_OrcOgre_Story_Rexxar_Mission1Idle_03	The land sustains us. The beasts answer us. What more do you want?
	
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission2Intro_01	Words are weak. You must fight to be heard.
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission2ExchangeA_01	You are one of the mok'nathal, aren't you?
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission2ExchangeB_01	I could destroy your clan in a heartbeat.
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission2ExchangeC_01	HAH! All's fair in war, boy. The orcs have sacrificed much…
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission2ExchangeC_02	Defeat me, and I'll consider your request.
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission2ExchangeD_01	You fight well for your kind. I have need of champions like you.
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission2Victory_01	Cease this! You've persuaded me. But in return, you must serve the Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	More words, boy?
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission2HeroPower_01	For the Horde!
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission2HeroPower_02	Tremble before me!
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission2HeroPower_03	Do not test my patience.
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission2Loss_01	You are only a half-orc, unworthy of my attention.
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission2Idle_01	The Horde was forged through blood and fear. 
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission2Idle_02	My clan was born for greatness… to conquer all. That is our legacy. 
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission2Idle_03	Power is the only law that all must obey.

VO_Story_Minion_Mogrin_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission4Intro_01	Come, you quilboar mongrels! Taste the steel of Mogrin's axe!
VO_Story_Minion_Mogrin_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission4ExchangeA_01	They came out of nowhere! 
VO_Story_Minion_Mogrin_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission4ExchangeB_01	I know. This would be a good death… if not for my failure.
VO_Story_Minion_Mogrin_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission4ExchangeC_01	I was to deliver… a crucial report… to my chieftain. 
VO_Story_Minion_Mogrin_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission4ExchangeC_02	But now… I cannot. I have lost my honor.
VO_Story_Minion_Mogrin_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission4ExchangeD_01	Seek out the city of Orgrimmar. Find Warchief Thrall. Tell him…
VO_Story_Minion_Mogrin_Male_Orc_Story_Mogrin_Play_01	These Quillboar are cowards!

VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission4Victory_01	I see. You have done us a great service. Please accept our hospitality here in Durotar.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission7Intro_01	That was a different time. The Horde has changed.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission7ExchangeA_01	Of course not. Still, you know what we must do.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission7ExchangeB_01	We must put an end to the admiral. Only then will the Horde be safe.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission7ExchangeD_01	You are the Champion of the Horde. Our victory will come through you, or not at all.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Rexxar_Mission7Victory_01	You saved us all, Rexxar. I can never repay you. Will you stay with us?
	
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission5Intro_01	We have to clear them out. Then we can discover what really happened here.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission5ExchangeA_01	I'll help you as much as I can.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission5ExchangeB_01	I hope you trust me.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission5ExchangeC_01	Our future peace hinges on what we find here. It worries me.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission5ExchangeD_01	We aren't so different. I think our people want the same things.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission5ExchangeE_01	I recognize that footman… I think I know what happened here. 
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission5ExchangeE_02	I'll explain later.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission5Victory_01	Father. I knew this was your doing. You have to understand—the Horde is no longer our enemy!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission5Victory_02	Rexxar, run!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission7ExchangeA_01	Thrall, Rexxar… I just want you to know that I had no part in this. 
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission7ExchangeA_02	Yes. I will leave you to it.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Darkscale_Female_Naga_Story_Rexxar_Mission5Intro_01	The seasss are ours!
VO_Story_Hero_Darkscale_Female_Naga_Story_Rexxar_Mission5ExchangeF_01	Ssstand down!
VO_Story_Hero_Darkscale_Female_Naga_Story_Rexxar_Mission5ExchangeG_01	We will reclaim our landsss.
VO_Story_Hero_Darkscale_Female_Naga_Story_Rexxar_Mission5EmoteResponse_01	Surface dwellers are so strange.
VO_Story_Hero_Darkscale_Female_Naga_Story_Rexxar_Mission5HeroPower_01	Athero bathre'las!
VO_Story_Hero_Darkscale_Female_Naga_Story_Rexxar_Mission5HeroPower_02	For Nazjatar!
VO_Story_Hero_Darkscale_Female_Naga_Story_Rexxar_Mission5HeroPower_03	Face my storm!
VO_Story_Hero_Darkscale_Female_Naga_Story_Rexxar_Mission5Loss_01	We controlled the world once… and we shall again.
VO_Story_Hero_Darkscale_Female_Naga_Story_Rexxar_Mission5Idle_01	A human and a half-orc work together? What nonsense.
VO_Story_Hero_Darkscale_Female_Naga_Story_Rexxar_Mission5Idle_02	Your petty disagreements mean nothing to me.
VO_Story_Hero_Darkscale_Female_Naga_Story_Rexxar_Mission5Idle_03	I'll show YOU who's washed up.
	
VO_Story_Minion_Footman_Male_Human_Story_Footman_Play_01	Mistress Jaina? Is that you?
	
VO_Story_Hero_Daelin_Male_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission5Victory_01	Ah, Jaina. I've found you at last!
VO_Story_Hero_Daelin_Male_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission5Victory_02	So naïve, my dear. Step aside, an extermination is in order.
VO_Story_Hero_Daelin_Male_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission7Intro_01	Come, savages! Atone for what you did in Stormwind! In Lordaeron!
VO_Story_Hero_Daelin_Male_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission7ExchangeE_01	Monsters, all of you!
VO_Story_Hero_Daelin_Male_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission7ExchangeF_01	You will never know what it is to defend your home, your loved ones. You abandoned your world to destroy ours.
VO_Story_Hero_Daelin_Male_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission7EmoteResponse_01	I don't know how my daughter put up with you.
VO_Story_Hero_Daelin_Male_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission7HeroPower_01	Fire the cannon!
VO_Story_Hero_Daelin_Male_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission7HeroPower_02	Strike their weakness!
VO_Story_Hero_Daelin_Male_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission7HeroPower_03	Eliminate them!
VO_Story_Hero_Daelin_Male_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission7Loss_01	I always knew it. Those savages cannot work together.
VO_Story_Hero_Daelin_Male_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission7Idle_01	Peace is like a dream. Beautiful, ephemeral, unobtainable.
VO_Story_Hero_Daelin_Male_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission7Idle_02	A pity my daughter did not inherit my keen judge of character.
VO_Story_Hero_Daelin_Male_Human_Story_Rexxar_Mission7Idle_03	The Horde killed my son. My flesh and blood. I will never forgive them.
	
VO_Story_02_Centaur_Male_Centaur_Story_Rexxar_Mission6Intro_01	The tauren is ours, fool.
VO_Story_02_Centaur_Male_Centaur_Story_Rexxar_Mission6ExchangeB_01	This will end with you in a cage, half-orc.
VO_Story_02_Centaur_Male_Centaur_Story_Rexxar_Mission6ExchangeC_01	You have lost more warriors than the one you seek to gain.
VO_Story_02_Centaur_Male_Centaur_Story_Rexxar_Mission6EmoteResponse_01	Do you think we are stupid?
VO_Story_02_Centaur_Male_Centaur_Story_Rexxar_Mission6HeroPower_01	Fight for us now!
VO_Story_02_Centaur_Male_Centaur_Story_Rexxar_Mission6HeroPower_02	This one will be dearly missed.
VO_Story_02_Centaur_Male_Centaur_Story_Rexxar_Mission6HeroPower_03	Follow the khan.
VO_Story_02_Centaur_Male_Centaur_Story_Rexxar_Mission6Loss_01	Foolish meddling half-orcs…
VO_Story_02_Centaur_Male_Centaur_Story_Rexxar_Mission6Idle_01	You are no ally to the tauren. Why save him?
VO_Story_02_Centaur_Male_Centaur_Story_Rexxar_Mission6Idle_02	We have never kidnapped a half-orc, half-ogre before…
VO_Story_02_Centaur_Male_Centaur_Story_Rexxar_Mission6Idle_03	The tauren do not belong here. Neither do you.
	
VO_Story_Minion_Baine_Male_Tauren_Story_Rexxar_Mission6ExchangeA_01	My father knows I am here?! You must get me to him!
VO_Story_Minion_Baine_Male_Tauren_Story_Rexxar_Mission6Victory_01	Yes, my friend. I owe everything to you. Whatever you wish, my father will grant to you.
	
VO_Story_Minion_Cairne_Male_Tauren_Story_Rexxar_Mission7ExchangeC_01	We are with you, Rexxar! Lead on!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Gorgrom_Male_Gronn_Story_Rexxar_Mission8Intro_01	Who disturbs Gorgrom?
VO_Story_Hero_Gorgrom_Male_Gronn_Story_Rexxar_Mission8Intro_02	You too small to be champion.
VO_Story_Hero_Gorgrom_Male_Gronn_Story_Rexxar_Mission8ExchangeC_01	Your blood weak. You smell like ogre, but small like orc.
VO_Story_Hero_Gorgrom_Male_Gronn_Story_Rexxar_Mission8ExchangeD_01	I no like traps!
VO_Story_Hero_Gorgrom_Male_Gronn_Story_Rexxar_Mission8ExchangeE_01	I no see that coming.
VO_Story_Hero_Gorgrom_Male_Gronn_Story_Rexxar_Mission8EmoteResponse_01	What you say?
VO_Story_Hero_Gorgrom_Male_Gronn_Story_Rexxar_Mission8HeroPower_01	<_growl_>
VO_Story_Hero_Gorgrom_Male_Gronn_Story_Rexxar_Mission8HeroPower_02	I am greatest gronn!
VO_Story_Hero_Gorgrom_Male_Gronn_Story_Rexxar_Mission8HeroPower_03	You no match for me.
VO_Story_Hero_Gorgrom_Male_Gronn_Story_Rexxar_Mission8Loss_01	Puny beings no bother great Gorgrom.
VO_Story_Hero_Gorgrom_Male_Gronn_Story_Rexxar_Mission8Idle_01	I am son of Gruul Dragonkiller. I kill dragons too. By eating.
VO_Story_Hero_Gorgrom_Male_Gronn_Story_Rexxar_Mission8Idle_02	Bloodmaul follow me. Mok'nathal follow Bloodmaul.
VO_Story_Hero_Gorgrom_Male_Gronn_Story_Rexxar_Mission8Idle_03	You have nice bear. Gorgrom like bear.

VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_Start_01	I will savor this victory!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_StartMirror_01	Is that you, Uther? No more pranks!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_StartIllucia_01	A priest should be devoted to the Light, yet you lurk in shadow.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_StartWillow_01	I cannot trust this magic of yours.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_StartStelina_01	Are you considering a career in teaching?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_StartSlate_01	Ah, Professor Slate. This will be a battle of wits!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_StartOmu_01	The power of nature cannot compete with the Light!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_StartFireheart_01	A friendly match then, Instructor Fireheart?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_StartMozaki_01	I admit, I've never gotten along with trolls.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_StartLilian_01	Are you even supposed to be here?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_StartRattllegore_01	The Light has forsaken you!


VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_StartKelThuzad_01	May the Light shine down upon Scholomance!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_Attack_1	Press the attack!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_Attack_02	Light guide me!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_WellPlayed_01	Well done.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_Greetings_01	My faith is my shield.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_Oops_01	No one saw that.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_Welcome_01	Well met.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_Thanks_01	My thanks.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_Wow_01	I am beyond words!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_Threaten_01	The Light will reveal all treachery!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_LowCards_01	I am low on cards.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_NoCards_01	My cards are gone!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_Concede_01	Savor your victory.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_Time_01	Time is against me.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_Error_01	I cannot do that.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_ErrorSpace_01	I don't have room.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Turalyon_Male_Human_Picked_01	The Light will be with us. 
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_Start_01	I knew I'd achieve more with a double.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_StartMirror_01	I'm afraid only one of us can win.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_StartTuralyon_01	I do things my own way.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_StartWillow_01	You have some skill, but not as much as me.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_StartStelina_01	Let's see if you're as good as your grades are.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_StartSlate_01	I've never seen anyone so serious about mushrooms.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_StartOmu_01	Are you a teacher? Or a shrub?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_StartFireheart_01	May cooler heads prevail.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_StartMozaki_01	This will be a most amusing test.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_StartLilian_01	Get out of my school, trespasser!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_StartRattllegore_01	So this is where you were hiding…
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_StartKelThuzad_01	Alexei and I support you completely.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_Attack_01	Consider this your greatest test.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_WellPlayed_01	The competition is fierce, isn't it?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_Greetings_01	Ah, it's you.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_Oops_01	How dreadful.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_Welcome_01	Welcome to Scholomance.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_Thanks_01	That was very useful.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_Wow_01	Intriguing!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_LowCards_01	My cards are low.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_NoCards_01	I'm out of cards!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_Threaten_01	I am a Barov. We OWN this school!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_Concede_01	I've had enough!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_Time_01	I must be quick.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_Error_01	I can't.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_ErrorSpace_01	There isn't room!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Illucia_Female_Human_Picked_01	I knew you would pick me.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_Start_01	I didn't want my inner conflict to manifest this way.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_StartMirror_01	I know.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_StartTuralyon_01	What are you gonna do, pray for me?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_StartIllucia_01	Illucia. I knew you'd be my rival sooner or later.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_StartStelina_01	Hey, YOU. It's detention time!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_StartSlate_01	Professor Slate. What a surprise!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_StartOmu_01	Just a warning--I have a black thumb.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_StartFireheart_01	I hope you don't mind. I'm winning this whole thing.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_StartMozaki_01	I guess they'll give anyone tenure these days.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_StartLilian_01	You're in far over your head, infiltrator.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_StartRattllegore_01	How can I kill what's already dead?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_StartKelThuzad_01	Headmaster! What an honor.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_WellPlayed_01	Are you actually learning?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_Greetings_01	Salutations.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_Oops_01	An amusing mistake.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_Welcome_01	You're welcome.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_Thanks_01	Right. Thanks.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_Wow_01	That's actually quite good.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_Threaten_01	Things are about to take a dark turn.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_LowCards_01	Getting low on cards.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_NoCards_01	No more cards.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_Concede_01	I'm out!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_Time_01	Running out of time.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_Error_01	Definitely can't.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_ErrorSpace_01	Nope, no room.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Willow_Female_Human_Picked_01	Oh, what troubles we'll bring…
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_Start_01	Oh no, it's YOU. I mean ME.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_StartMirror_01	How am I going to copy my own test?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_StartTuralyon_01	Oh hi, Professor Turalyon…
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_StartIllucia_01	Go easy on me, Lady Barov. I'm your top student!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_StartWillow_01	Are you trying to stain my perfect record?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_StartSlate_01	I always wanted to ask… what's with the mushrooms?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_StartOmu_01	I never thought I'd see this class…
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_StartFireheart_01	Instructor Fireheart? Let's compare notes.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_StartMozaki_01	Don't mages get bored without any weapons?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_StartLilian_01	What kind of spy sneaks into a magic school?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_StartRattllegore_01	Where did you come from?!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_StartKelThuzad_01	I'm your star pupil! Who else would you want?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_Attack_01	I always come out on top!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_WellPlayed_01	You're a smart one, hm?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_Greetings_01	Hello! Will this fight be on the test?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_Oops_01	Yikes.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_Welcome_01	Future valedictorian at your service.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_Thanks_01	Thank you so much!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_Wow_01	I didn't think of that!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_LowCards_01	I'm low on cards.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_NoCards_01	Oof, no more cards.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_Threaten_01	You'll be in trouble for fighting a student!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_Concede_01	Time for summer break!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_Time_01	I'm short on time.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_Error_01	I can't do that.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_ErrorSpace_01	I don't have space.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Stelina_Female_NightElf_Picked_01	I always get picked first!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_Start_01	Oh hey, are you a new professor?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_StartMirror_01	It sure feels like I'm one of the old ones!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_StartTuralyon_01	I get to fight the great Turalyon? How invigorating!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_StartIllucia_01	Ah, I've wanted to show you my latest research!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_StartWillow_01	What was it you're working on again?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_StartStelina_01	My work can't be grasped by undergrads!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_StartOmu_01	Hm… did you bring any mushrooms for me, Omu?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_StartFireheart_01	Uhhh, terribly sorry to fight you, but the headmaster requires it!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_StartMozaki_01	I didn't realize YOU were interested in research!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_StartLilian_01	Ah, are you new here?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_StartRattllegore_01	Who let this monstrosity in?!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_StartKelThuzad_01	I'm ready for my review, Headmaster!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_Attack_01	This one's potent…
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_Attack_02	Would you look at that!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_Attack_03	So fresh! So strong!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_WellPlayed_01	I'd give you an "A" in field studies!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_Greetings_01	Oh, hello there! 
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_Oops_01	Whoops!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_Welcome_01	Lifelong learners are welcome here.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_Thanks_01	Thank you, thank you.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_Wow_01	Zounds!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_LowCards_01	Not many cards left.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_NoCards_01	Fresh out of cards!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_Threaten_01	Your academic career will be in tatters!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_Concede_01	I must return to the field.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_Time_01	I'm low on time.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_Error_01	Oh no, no, no.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_ErrorSpace_01	Things need room to grow!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Slate_Male_Human_Picked_01	What? Yes! Hello!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_Start_01	Hm, do I have a twin offshoot?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_StartMirror_01	Let the stronger of us decide!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_StartTuralyon_01	We will see who grows strongest.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_StartIllucia_01	Why look, it's the mysterious Lady Barov!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_StartWillow_01	Witness the ways of my forest!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_StartStelina_01	All transfer students are welcome.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_StartSlate_01	Today I bring only the might of nature!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_StartFireheart_01	We should share this position, as we share our students!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_StartMozaki_01	There is magic you do not know.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_StartLilian_01	You are neither student nor teacher. Why are you here?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_StartRattllegore_01	There is no life within you, twisted wretch!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_StartKelThuzad_01	Your research will flourish under my care.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_WellPlayed_01	You are growing strong!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_Greetings_01	Be one with nature.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_Oops_01	Oops! This is a teaching moment.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_Welcome_01	All are welcome in my forest.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_Thanks_01	Thank you.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_Wow_01	I see you are thriving!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_LowCards_01	My cards are few.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_NoCards_01	I am out of cards.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_Threaten_01	You have outgrown my patience.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_Concede_01	Some thrive, some wilt.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_Time_01	Time is of the essence.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_Error_01	I must not.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_ErrorSpace_01	There is no room.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Omu_Female_Botani_Picked_01	There is a time to sow… and a time to reap.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_Start_01	I won't go easy on you. I dislike imitators. 
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_StartMirror_01	Please. I'm a true original.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_StartTuralyon_01	Sorcery versus plate? I like it.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_StartIllucia_01	Is this my review, Lady Barov? Or a challenge?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_StartWillow_01	Hah! The headmaster wouldn't let YOU research his afternoon snack!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_StartStelina_01	You know little of the ways of the elements…
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_StartSlate_01	You can always withdraw from the competition, professor.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_StartOmu_01	I asked, but Headmaster Kel'Thuzad did not agree. So we fight!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_StartMozaki_01	I knew I'd be fighting you for my promotion.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_StartLilian_01	No one sits in on my class for free!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_StartRattllegore_01	You do not belong here. Time for an expulsion!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_StartKelThuzad_01	The flames bend to my will!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_Attack_01	Here's another test!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_WellPlayed_01	I see you've done your studies.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_Oops_01	No shame in learning.
VO_SCH_507_Female_Human_Play_01	Never be afraid of your inner power. 
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_Welcome_01	My classroom's always open.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_Thanks_01	Thanks.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_Wow_01	Did you graduate with honors?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_LowCards_01	I am low on cards.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_NoCards_01	No more cards!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_Threaten_01	There are two things I can't stand--mouthy students and ignorant teachers.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_Concede_01	I know when I've lost.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_Time_01	I don't have much time.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_Error_01	I can't do that.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_ErrorSpace_01	There's no space.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Fireheart_Female_Human_Picked_01	Let's put our studies to practice, hm?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_Start_01	Look, it be just like a Mirror Image!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_StartMirror_01	Hah, I enjoy that one.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_StartTuralyon_01	I DESPISE paladins like you.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_StartIllucia_01	What can I say, I make learning fun!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_StartWillow_01	Unlike you, I DESERVE to be here.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_StartStelina_01	Spells be the greatest weapon of all.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_StartSlate_01	I just love a good duel.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_StartOmu_01	Please. Your humble plants cannot compare with ME.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_StartFireheart_01	It be yours to lose, then.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_StartLilian_01	You look suspicious. I will write you up!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_StartRattllegore_01	This THING is not on the faculty!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_StartKelThuzad_01	I'll impress you. I promise.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_WellPlayed_01	You try hard. I'll give you that.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_Greetings_01	It's not a competition. I'm too good!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_Oops_01	That was awkward.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_Welcome_01	Welcome to my advanced class.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_Thanks_01	Hah, thank you.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_Wow_01	I didn't know you had it in you!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_LowCards_01	I be getting low on cards.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_NoCards_01	All out of cards!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_Threaten_01	The only bad thing about being the best is how lonely it is…
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_Concede_01	I don't have time for this!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_Time_01	Better hurry!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_Error_01	No, I can't.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_ErrorSpace_01	Not enough room!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Mozaki_Female_Troll_Picked_01	Let me show you the ways of a master duelist…
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_Start_01	Are you trying to ruin my espionage?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_StartMirror_01	No, but you're ruining mine!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_StartTuralyon_01	Try to keep quiet, would you?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_StartIllucia_01	Aiding Kel'Thuzad will destroy your family!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_StartWillow_01	I know the truth. You're necromancers, all of you!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_StartStelina_01	Go back to class! Leave me alone!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_StartSlate_01	Would you believe this is my first day?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_StartOmu_01	I dont actually mean you any harm, but there is no other way.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_StartFireheart_01	Don't get the wrong idea. There's nothing I could learn from you!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_StartMozaki_01	I will fight every teacher here if I have to.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_StartRattllegore_01	I'll put you out of your misery.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_StartKelThuzad_01	I know what you're doing, and you won't get away with it!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_Attack_01	My blades stay sharp.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_WellPlayed_01	You're awfully good for someone who shouldn't be doing this.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_Greetings_01	Hello. What is it you ask?
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_Oops_01	Unintended consequences…
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_Welcome_01	Welcome to your reckoning.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_Thanks_01	Thanks, I guess.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_Wow_01	What was that?!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_LowCards_01	Low on cards.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_NoCards_01	I'm out of cards!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_Threaten_01	Your school is EVIL--even more than schools usually are.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_Concede_01	I tried my best.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_Time_01	I'm almost out of time.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_Error_01	I can't.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_ErrorSpace_01	No room.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Lilian_Female_Human_Picked_01	We'll get to the bottom of this.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Rattlegore_Male_Undead_Start_01	<_irritated roar_>
VO_TB_PVPDR_Rattlegore_Male_Undead_StartMirror_01	<_confused snarl_>
VO_TB_PVPDR_Rattlegore_Male_Undead_Attack_01	<_throaty growl_>
VO_TB_PVPDR_Rattlegore_Male_Undead_WellPlayed_01	Ooo…
VO_TB_PVPDR_Rattlegore_Male_Undead_Greetings_01	<_grunt_>
VO_TB_PVPDR_Rattlegore_Male_Undead_Oops_01	<_smaller growl_>
VO_TB_PVPDR_Rattlegore_Male_Undead_NoCards_01	<_negative grunt like "nuh uh"_>
VO_TB_PVPDR_Rattlegore_Male_Undead_Threaten_01	<_medium-size roar_>
VO_TB_PVPDR_Rattlegore_Male_Undead_Concede_01	<_raspy sigh_>
VO_TB_PVPDR_Rattlegore_Male_Undead_Picked_01	<_Excited roar!_>
VO_TB_PVPDR_HH_Male_Human_Start_01	I ride through darkness and by chance, tonight I vanquish Scholomance!
VO_TB_PVPDR_HH_Male_Human_StartMirror_01	Yet what twisted fate lies within as I face my evil-ER twin!
VO_TB_PVPDR_HH_Male_Human_Welcome_01	Welcome, mortal! AHAHAHA!
VO_TB_PVPDR_HH_Male_Human_LowCards_01	I am low on cards!
VO_TB_PVPDR_HH_Male_Human_NoCards_01	Out of cards!
VO_TB_PVPDR_HH_Male_Human_Time_01	Out of time, but not of rhyme!
VO_TB_PVPDR_HH_Male_Human_Error_01	I cannot.
VO_TB_PVPDR_HH_Male_Human_ErrorSpace_01	I lack the space.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Bob_Male_Human_TavernLegendary_01	That's a nice legendary you got there, friend!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Bob_Male_Human_TavernCollection_01	What a collection you've got! Lookin' sharp.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Bob_Male_Human_TavernCollection_02	Hey! You've got some great pals with you!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Bob_Male_Human_TavernCollection_03	Ahh, I think I get your style.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Bob_Male_Human_TavernType_01	I'm seeing a trend here! Guess I know what you like.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Bob_Male_Human_TavernWeapons_01	Weapons, huh? I've got something special for ya.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Bob_Male_Human_TavernGreeting_01	Cheer up, friend. It's sloppy joe day!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Bob_Male_Human_TavernGreeting_02	Don't let 'em get to ya. Have a cup of cocoa, and you'll feel better.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Bob_Male_Human_TavernGreeting_03	Don't know why they gave me this hair net, but here we are.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Bob_Male_Human_TavernGreeting_04	Don't give up yet. I saved you a table in the cafeteria!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Bob_Male_Human_TavernGreeting_05	I got what you need, friend. Minions. And… creamed corn!
VO_TB_PVPDR_Bob_Male_Human_TavernGreeting_06	Even the great ones tinker with their deck now and again.
VO_TB_PVPDR_Bob_Male_Human_TavernGreeting_07	Saved by the bell! You're still in this one, you know. 
VO_TB_PVPDR_Bob_Male_Human_TavernGreeting_08	Things weren't this tough when I went to school. 
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_Intro_Banner_01	Welcome, faculty! I have something SPECIAL in mind for this summer…
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_Intro_Banner_02	The semester is coming to an end, so you may be wondering what happens next?
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_Intro_01	I am conducting some groundbreaking new research, but I need the very BEST teacher for it. Could that be you? 
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_TreasurePick_01	Kindly bring your materials along.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_TreasurePick_02	I expect to see your top performance!
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_TreasurePick_93	Try to impress me.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_TreasurePick_04	You have unlocked a greater treasure! Although I'd gladly take it myself.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_TreasurePick_05	I see you're quite the collector… Take this.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_EnemyScreen_01	Your competition will be… your peers.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_EnemyScreen_02	There's only one spot. So, try to win!
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_EnemyScreen_03	Only one teacher is worthy of my attention.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_EnemyScreen_04	Come now… haven't you always wanted to fight it out?
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_EnemyScreen_05	Wait, aren't you a student? Oh well…
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_Victory_01	I must say, you've surprised me! Your academic career just became VERY promising…
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_Victory_02	I see great things in your future! Don't you, Mr. Bigglesworth? <_FX: Cat hissing_> I'm sure he agrees.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_Victory_03	You are just who I was looking for. Maybe you'll even make it to headmaster someday! Haha, who am I kidding.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_Start_01	It's ME? I'm the best of Scholomance?
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_StartMirror_01	I mean, it makes sense.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_StartTuralyon_01	Your boundless zeal is very promising.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_StartIllucia_01	This is only the beginning of our grand work!
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_StartWillow_01	Now I may monitor your progress more directly.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_StartStelina_01	A student defeated my faculty? Interesting.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_StartSlate_01	To be honest, you're a bit of a mystery to me.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_StartOmu_01	I… don't know if you're right for this assignment.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_StartFireheart_01	Fireheart, eh? Maybe you should chill out.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_StartMozaki_01	I have to warn you, I'm a harsh judge of mages.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_StartLilian_01	An intruder?! You'll pay for trespassing here…
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_StartRattlegore_01	Of course, an undead servant is the best of all.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_Attack_01	Don't disappoint me!
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_Attack_02	Taste this!
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_FirstBossLoss_01	Don’t be discouraged. Some of my faculty members are VERY easy to outsmart.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_FirstBossLoss_02	Keep trying and study hard to succeed. Or at least I would, if I didn’t cheat.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_MediumRun_01	Ah yes, the field is shaping up nicely. I’d give you a passing grade!
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_MediumRun_02	You have potential. Keep going, and you could make it to department chair.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_GoodRun_01	What glorious scholarship! You have earned an “A”!
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_GoodRun_02	Ohh, I have some WONDROUS opportunities for you, my friend.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_ExceptionalRun_01	My congratulations! You’ve thrown off the grading curve with your success.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_TutorialOpponents_01	We must find you an opponent of… similar qualifications. 
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_TutorialMatchmaking_01	Your opponents have been given similar opportunities to craft a deck.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_TreasureDraw_01	Ah yes. Academia has its rewards.
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_TreasureDraw_02	These should help. Or at least cause some chaos. 
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_TreasureDraw_03	Ah, treasures from the Scholomance vaults!
VO_TB_PVPDR_KelThuzad_Male_Human_TreasureDraw_04	I see you've both been collecting treasures…
VO_SWL_26H_03_Male_Demon_Attack_01	There is no escape.
VO_SWL_26H_03_Male_Demon_Greetings_01	Nothing shall remain of this world.
VO_SWL_26H_03_Male_Demon_Oops_01	<_growls_>
VO_SWL_26H_03_Male_Demon_Welcome_01	The Lord of Terror sees you.
VO_SWL_26H_03_Male_Demon_Thanks_01	As it was foretold.
VO_SWL_26H_03_Male_Demon_Wow_01	How surprising.
VO_SWL_26H_03_Male_Demon_LowCards_01	I am low on cards.
VO_SWL_26H_03_Male_Demon_NoCards_01	Out of cards!
VO_SWL_26H_03_Male_Demon_Concede_01	Savor this moment.
VO_SWL_26H_03_Male_Demon_Time_01	Time is short.
VO_SWL_26H_03_Male_Demon_ErrorPlay_01	Not possible.
VO_SWL_26H_03_Male_Demon_ErrorFullMinions_01	Not enough space.
VO_SWL_26H_03_Male_Demon_Picked_01	I am terror incarnate.
VO_SWL_26H_03_Male_Demon_MirrorStart_01	Finally a match made in Hell.
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Attack_01	Be gone!
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Concede_01	I… give in.
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_ErrorFullMinions_01	Our warriors need more space.
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_ErrorPlay_01	A tactical mistake.
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Greetings_01	Blood and Thunder!
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_GreetingsMirror_01	Loktar' Ogar!
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_LowCards_01	I am low on cards.
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_MirrorStart_01	Finally, a worthy opponent.
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_NoCards_01	I am out of cards.
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Oops_01	OOF! That will bite.
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Picked_01	You rally with the Frost Wolves!
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Play_01	Lets get on with it.
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Start_01	For the Frostwolf Clan!
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_StartVandar_01	Ahhh Stormpike, Alterac Valley belongs to the Frostwolves!
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Thanks_01	I thank you.
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Threaten_01	Today you will meet your ancestors!
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Time_01	Time runs low.
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Welcome_01	Blood and honor, friend.
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_WellPlayed_01	You fight with honor.
VO_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Wow_01	Huh, impressive.



VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_PreMission1_01	My life began under the shadow of a curse. Years ago, my father was the first orc to drink demons' blood, corrupting the Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_PreMission1_02	They left for war, leaving only those of us who were sick and weak behind.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_PreMission1_03	It was not until I was much older I learned the truth of his redemption.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1Intro_01	I don't want to hear it.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1ExchangeB_01	All your "news" is about the past. I hate it.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1ExchangeC_01	I just don't want to hear about my father and all of his terrible crimes!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1ExchangeD_01	I know that my bloodline is tainted… I can only hurt my people.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1Victory_01	A great burden has been lifted from my shoulders… Thank you, Thrall.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Hero_GarroshThreaten_01	I have no patience for this.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Hero_GarroshAttack_01	For honor!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Hero_GarroshConcede_01	Nevermind.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_PreMission2_01	Thrall invited me to join him as his advisor on the world of Azeroth. 
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_PreMission2_02	I knew I was ready to follow in my father's great legacy, but not all of Thrall's other advisors agreed…
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2Intro_01	I am no boy. You weaken the Horde with compromise and capitulation!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2ExchangeA_01	And I will not suffer weakness!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2ExchangeB_01	Jealous words from a feeble foe.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2ExchangeC_02	I see the Horde as it should have been—bold and strong.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2Victory_01	Think more carefully before you cross me next time.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_PreMission3_01	When the Scourge attacked, I had a chance to prove the strength of my strategy to everyone.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_PreMission3_02	Thrall sent me to Northrend to lead the Horde Expedition and eliminate our enemies.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission3Intro_01	We will annihilate your kind from the face of this world!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission3PeonInfo_01	I can call on peons if I need more forces.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission3Summon_01	Forward, peon!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission3Summon_02	Charge at the enemy!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission3Summon_03	Go!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission3ExchangeA_01	The Horde will not endure your attacks any longer!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission3ExchangeB_01	Soon, your kind will only exist in memory.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission3Victory_01	We have subdued the Scourge and secured our foothold in Northrend.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_PreMission4_01	I returned to Orgrimmar for a hero's welcome. But it was short-lived—soon after, the city was invaded by raging elementals.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_PreMission4_02	I was ready to fight—to prove my valor yet again.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission4Intro_01	Elemental rifts have opened up around the city. I need to shut them down now!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission4ExchangeA_01	Thrall has evacuated those who cannot fight. They will be safe.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission4ExchangeB_01	Crush these elementals! Drive them from our land!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission4ExchangeC_01	Thrall, what could be happening here?
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission4Victory_01	I will not fail you, Warchief.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_PreMission5_01	Thrall's advisors had promised to support me, but instead they turned on me the moment the Warchief was gone.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_PreMission5_02	One of them, Cairne Bloodhoof, was so bold as to challenge me to a Mak'gora… a duel for leadership of the Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission5Intro_01	Have you come to fight me, old bull?
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission5ExchangeA_01	Well played. It would seem it's just your wits that are slow.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission5ExchangeB_01	Hah!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission5ExchangeC_01	I think you mean "cowardice." And I do not trust it at all.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission5Victory_01	The great Cairne Bloodhoof has fallen! Think again before questioning me!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission5Victory_02	But wait… wasn't that almost TOO easy?
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_PreMission6_01	Magatha aided me in the Mak'gora and stained my honor. In return, she was exiled by the tauren.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_PreMission6_02	With our united force, I knew the Horde could achieve great things. 
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_PreMission6_03	Our first step would be securing our land by eliminating the Alliance at Theramore…
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission6ExchangeA_01	Strike the gates!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission6ExchangeB_01	The gates are down! Destroy the Alliance!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission6ExchangeC_01	Only your immediate surrender.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission6ExchangeD_01	Your "peace" was a pathetic lie!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_PreMission7_01	The Alliance were eager for vengeance, but they could not take it so long as we retained our advantage.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_PreMission7_02	To ensure this, I sought an artifact in Pandaria, the Divine Bell. But the enemy was quick to interfere…
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission7Intro_01	With the Divine Bell, I will burn away any remnants of weakness within the Horde's warriors!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission7ExchangeA_01	Haha... so in the end, it is not Varian, but his whelp who comes to face me. 
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission7ExchangeA_02	You run bravely to your death, young one!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission7ExchangeB_01	Stop me then, human.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission7ShaCallout_01	Fight the sha—master it! Use it!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission7ShaCallout_02	Doubt is for the weak!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission7ShaCallout_03	Control your hatred, your fear!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission7Victory_01	Die, whelp! Your Alliance must be at its end if it's sending children against me.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_PreMission8_01	With great effort, I located another, superior artifact: the Heart of Y'Shaarj. But traitors within the Horde feared my power. 
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_PreMission8_02	Warriors who should have served me instead turned to Thrall, begging him to return.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8Intro_01	You betrayed our people by leaving them. And now you betray me!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8ExchangeA_01	My dark shaman have twisted the elements. They cannot hear you now.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8ExchangeB_01	Anger. Hatred. Fear! They are the weapons of war—the tools of a Warchief!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8ExchangeB_02	Yes... I can see the future of this world... A world ruled by the Horde... MY Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8ExchangeC_01	The old one calls to you.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8Victory_01	I struck him down, and the former Warchief of the Horde lay stunned in the dust. 
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8Victory_02	Thrall's adventurers overwhelmed me and made me their captive… for a time.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8Victory_03	But I showed them all what it means to find glory on the battlefield… to be an orc and a warrior… and to be called HELLSCREAM!
	
VO_Story_04_Geyah_Female_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1Intro_01	Garrosh, I have great news for you.
VO_Story_04_Geyah_Female_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1ExchangeA_01	Do not make me convince you the hard way.
VO_Story_04_Geyah_Female_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1ExchangeB_01	The past, the ancestors—they are in everything. 
VO_Story_04_Geyah_Female_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1ExchangeC_01	You have thin skin for such a strong youth.
VO_Story_04_Geyah_Female_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1ExchangeD_01	That isn't true. Your choices are your own.
VO_Story_04_Geyah_Female_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1Victory_01	Enough delaying! Listen to my grandson. He has come a long way.
VO_Story_04_Geyah_Female_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1EmoteResponse_01	Sharing your feelings is the best way forward.
VO_Story_04_Geyah_Female_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1HeroPower_01	Take a deep breath…
VO_Story_04_Geyah_Female_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1HeroPower_02	Healing is a process.
VO_Story_04_Geyah_Female_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1HeroPower_03	Hope grows from within.
VO_Story_04_Geyah_Female_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1Loss_01	Keep listening and learning. Things will happen for you in good time.
VO_Story_04_Geyah_Female_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1Idle_01	Our group suffered greatly from the pox, but it was our salvation in the end.
VO_Story_04_Geyah_Female_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1Idle_02	We Mag'har are not green skinned because we never drank the demons' blood.
VO_Story_04_Geyah_Female_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1Idle_03	People only see your father when they look at you, but that will change.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1Victory_01	Garrosh, son of Hellscream, your father lived and died as our greatest hero.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission1Victory_02	He saved us all by killing the demon Mannoroth and lifting the curse.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission3Victory_01	How goes the expedition, Garrosh?
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission3Victory_02	Well done, my friend. You impress me yet again. 
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission4ExchangeC_01	Something has disturbed the elements all over Azeroth… but I know not what.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission4Victory_01	You have secured the city, Garrosh. Now I must leave to learn the source of this unrest.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission4Victory_02	In my absence, I am instructing you to lead the Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission4Victory_03	You have the strength and courage that our people need to survive in these trying times.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8Intro_01	It is not too late, Garrosh. Lay down the mantle of Warchief, and we can end this here.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8ExchangeA_01	Spirits of the wind, the earth, the water, hear my call! Come to my aid!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8ExchangeC_01	I must correct the mistake I made long ago…
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8EmoteResponse_01	It pains me to hear you speak like this.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8HeroPower_01	For Doomhammer!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8HeroPower_02	You are unworthy!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8HeroPower_03	Blood and Thunder!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8Loss_01	I had such dreams for you, Garrosh. Now I must bury them…
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8Idle_01	I am never powerless. And never alone.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8Idle_02	I wish you could see that there are many ways to be strong.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission8Idle_03	At least Geyah will not know how far you fell…
	
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2Intro_01	Why do you always undermine my counsel, boy?
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2Intro_02	Foolish Mag'har…
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2ExchangeA_01	I will not tolerate your disrespect!
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2ExchangeB_01	Thrall should never have appointed you to advise him. Anyone could see your ignorance!
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2ExchangeC_01	You would lead us to senseless war.
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2Victory_01	You'll pay for your insolence one day…
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	Is that how you speak to your elders?
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2HeroPower_01	Feel the ground tremble!
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2HeroPower_02	I safeguard the Horde!
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2HeroPower_03	Earth, swallow my enemies!
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2Loss_01	I will ask Thrall to send you back to Draenor where you belong.
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2Idle_01	It isn't you Thrall loves, only the memory of your father.
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2Idle_02	We should have you cleaning the peons' boots to learn your place.
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Garrosh_Mission2Idle_03	Peace is achieved through negotiation. Even children know that.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Zarzhet_Female_Nerubian_Story_Garrosh_Mission3Intro_01	I must thank you for bringing these warriors to our ranks…
VO_Story_Hero_Zarzhet_Female_Nerubian_Story_Garrosh_Mission3ExchangeA_01	No, you'll aid us with them.
VO_Story_Hero_Zarzhet_Female_Nerubian_Story_Garrosh_Mission3ExchangeB_01	We nerubians are as timeless as rock, and ice, and bone.
VO_Story_Hero_Zarzhet_Female_Nerubian_Story_Garrosh_Mission3EmoteResponse_01	You are starting to bug me.
VO_Story_Hero_Zarzhet_Female_Nerubian_Story_Garrosh_Mission3HeroPower_01	Come to us…
VO_Story_Hero_Zarzhet_Female_Nerubian_Story_Garrosh_Mission3HeroPower_02	Be reborn.
VO_Story_Hero_Zarzhet_Female_Nerubian_Story_Garrosh_Mission3HeroPower_03	Death is not the end.
VO_Story_Hero_Zarzhet_Female_Nerubian_Story_Garrosh_Mission3Loss_01	A pity we could not convert you into a death knight…
VO_Story_Hero_Zarzhet_Female_Nerubian_Story_Garrosh_Mission3Idle_01	You're so unconcerned for your peons! You'd make a fine Scourge commander.
VO_Story_Hero_Zarzhet_Female_Nerubian_Story_Garrosh_Mission3Idle_02	You have never seen an enemy like the Scourge.
VO_Story_Hero_Zarzhet_Female_Nerubian_Story_Garrosh_Mission3Idle_03	Stay here too long, and your heart will grow as cold as this frozen land.

VO_Story_Hero_FireElemental_Male_Elemental_Story_Garrosh_Mission4Loss_01	<_elemental hiss_>
VO_Story_Hero_FireElemental_Male_Elemental_Story_Garrosh_Mission4Death_01	<_death exertion_>

VO_Story_Hero_Cairne_Male_Tauren_Story_Garrosh_Mission5Intro_01	Earth Mother guide my blows…
VO_Story_Hero_Cairne_Male_Tauren_Story_Garrosh_Mission5ExchangeA_01	You are not so clever as you think.
VO_Story_Hero_Cairne_Male_Tauren_Story_Garrosh_Mission5ExchangeB_01	I fight for more than myself. I fight for the future of the Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Cairne_Male_Tauren_Story_Garrosh_Mission5ExchangeC_01	I have lived my whole life with honor. You may trust my counsel.
VO_Story_Hero_Cairne_Male_Tauren_Story_Garrosh_Mission5EmoteResponse_01	I fear we may not find an agreement outside of battle.
VO_Story_Hero_Cairne_Male_Tauren_Story_Garrosh_Mission5HeroPower_01	Ishne'porah!
VO_Story_Hero_Cairne_Male_Tauren_Story_Garrosh_Mission5HeroPower_02	For honor!
VO_Story_Hero_Cairne_Male_Tauren_Story_Garrosh_Mission5HeroPower_03	Respect our ways.
VO_Story_Hero_Cairne_Male_Tauren_Story_Garrosh_Mission5Loss_01	Destruction is easy. Creating something that lasts is a true challenge.
VO_Story_Hero_Cairne_Male_Tauren_Story_Garrosh_Mission5Idle_01	You should learn from your elders, not fight them!
VO_Story_Hero_Cairne_Male_Tauren_Story_Garrosh_Mission5Idle_02	Thrall saw only his fondness for you, not who you truly are.
VO_Story_Hero_Cairne_Male_Tauren_Story_Garrosh_Mission5Idle_03	If only you were as skilled at listening as you are attacking.
	
VO_Story_Minion_Magatha_Female_Tauren_Story_Minion_Magatha_Play_01	I give you a great blessing…
	
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission6ExchangeC_01	Are there no terms you would consider?
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission6ExchangeD_01	There is no coming back from this.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission6Victory_01	The Horde will pay for this day.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission6EmoteResponse_01	If we could just negotiate, this would be much easier.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission6HeroPower_01	For Theramore!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission6HeroPower_02	You forced my hand!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission6HeroPower_03	I trusted Thrall. Why would you throw that away?
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission6Loss_01	Thank the Light that Theramore is safe…
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission6Idle_01	Don't you think Thrall would be ashamed of you for this?
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission6Idle_02	The people of Theramore just want peace.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission6Idle_03	We both have enough enemies without turning on each other!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission7Intro_01	Stop, Garrosh! You do not know what that bell is capable of!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission7ExchangeB_01	I will not let you do this. I swear to it!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission7ExchangeD_01	The mogu made the Divine Bell to create chaos, but the pandaren created a mallet to counter it. 
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission7ExchangeD_02	That mallet was hidden for thousands of years, until now.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission7EmoteResponse_01	How did you become so misguided?
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission7HeroPower_01	Let harmony ring out!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission7HeroPower_02	A new song is born.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission7HeroPower_03	This melody will heal you.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission7Loss_01	For all your efforts, you only destroyed yourself.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission7Idle_01	I researched this plan myself. Is it… obvious?
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission7Idle_02	We haven't met before, but uh, I'm Anduin Wrynn!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Garrosh_Mission7Idle_03	Honestly, I'm just trying to help you. The sha are dangerous.

VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission1_01	The Holy Light has always been a part of my life, illuminating everything in its radiance.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission1_02	With this blessing, I have been able to endure even the darkest of moments. Let me show you…
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1Intro_01	As a lad, I was a cleric in the Church of the Holy Light. But my mentor already had plans for me…
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1Intro_02	Yes, Archbishop.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1ExchangeA_01	How else would I improve?
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1ExchangeB_01	You seem worried, Archbishop.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1Victory_01	This… is an honor beyond words. I will make you proud.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission2_01	I grew in strength and piety. When the Horde came to Lordaeron's capital, I was ready to defend it.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission2_02	I loved my home and my people. I could not bear to see them besieged while I yet drew breath.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission2Intro_01	Be gone, fiend!
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission2ExchangeA_01	It truly will, Turalyon.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission2ExchangeB_01	I'll return them to the blasted portal they came from!
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission2ExchangeC_01	Do not speak to me of fate, you green-skinned brute!
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission2ExchangeD_01	Our walls must hold!
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission2ExchangeE_01	The walls are in peril!
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission2ExchangeF_01	Could it be? The Horde forces have splintered!
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission2Victory_01	Thank you, my liege.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission3_01	We tracked the Horde to their hiding place at Blackrock Spire. They'd built a fortress into the mountain, making it almost impossible to breach.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission3_02	Summoning our courage, we went to meet them head-on.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission3Intro_01	Righteousness is the only advantage I need!
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission3ExchangeA_01	The tides have turned. Without the rest of your forces, you are hopeless.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission3ExchangeB_01	And I pity a monster who can never know the Light's grace.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission3ExchangeC_01	I suppose you're not used to that.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission3Victory_01	Run and hide if you like. The Alliance always finds you.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission4_01	Even as we made gains against the enemy and captured their leader Doomhammer, we knew not how the war would end.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission4_02	When the remaining Horde rallied around the Dark Portal, it was clear that we had to destroy it.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission4Intro_01	Understood.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission4ExchangeA_01	Wouldn't want to.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission4ExchangeB_01	I'll make sure he gets a shot.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission4ExchangeD_01	Khadgar, now!
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission4Victory_01	Thank the Light! It's gone!
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission5_01	Over the years, King Terenas entrusted the tutelage of his son, Prince Arthas, to me.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission5_02	I was not as young as I used to be, but helping that boy grow into a fine young man kept me going, same as ever. 
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission5_03	When the orcs started causing trouble again, we were quick to answer.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission5Intro_01	Surrender the villagers, Blademaster!
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission5Intro_02	Not on my watch!
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission5ExchangeA_01	Remember, Arthas, we are paladins. Vengeance cannot be a part of what we do. 
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission5ExchangeA_02	If we allow our passions to turn to bloodlust, then we will become as vile as the orcs.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission5ExchangeB_01	Weren't you listening to me?
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission5ExchangeC_01	You're a good lad, just a bit hot-headed. Think before you act.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission5ExchangeC_02	Because I said so!
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission5Victory_01	We've done well, lad. This was a sound victory.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission5Victory_02	Have faith. We defeated their demons a long time ago. There's nothing left of them.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission6_01	I was right. The orcs weren't a threat to us—something far worse was rising.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission6_02	It began when Jaina Proudmoore warned me that Arthas was under attack in the village of Hearthglen.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission6_03	I rushed to help him. What else could I do?
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission6Intro_01	For Lordaeron! For the king!
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission6ExchangeA_01	Don't celebrate yet, son. This battle is far from over!
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission6ExchangeB_01	What are these abominations?
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission6ExchangeB_02	We knew people were getting sick, but not the cause…
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission6ExchangeC_01	I'm surprised that you kept things together as long as you did.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission6ExchangeC_02	Now is not the time to be choking on pride! What we face here is only the beginning. 
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission7_01	Easy, lad. Brave as you are, you can't hope to defeat him all by yourself.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission7_02	Despite my misgivings, I followed the boy to Stratholme. The journey was a perilous one, with roads overrun by Scourge.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission7_03	My belief in Arthas, in his goodness, was too strong to push aside. I had to find him.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission7Intro_01	Never! I won't let you harm him!
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission7ExchangeA_01	Silence! You do not know his heart. I do.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission7ExchangeB_01	I won't give up!
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission7Victory_02	How can you even consider that? I cannot obey that command!
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission7Victory_04	You've just crossed a terrible threshold, Arthas.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission8_01	From that day forward, a darkness came over Arthas that could not be lifted. He turned against his own father, King Terenas.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_PreMission8_02	At that moment, I realized my worst enemy was the small lad I had raised to follow the Light. But still, my faith held.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8Intro_01	Your father ruled this land for seventy years, and you've ground it to dust in a matter of days.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8ExchangeA_01	I dearly hope that there's a special place in hell waiting for you.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8ExchangeB_01	I would have done anything for you. Given my life, even.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8ExchangeC_01	What could have changed you so?!
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8Victory_01	You may think this was a defeat. But when I closed my eyes, there was only Light.
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8Victory_02	I remembered everything I fought for… everyone I had loved and pledged loyalty to. 
VO_Story_Hero_Uther_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8Victory_03	And I knew I had lived up to my charge—to fight in the name of faith. I was blessed to do so.
	
VO_Story_03_Alonsus_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1Intro_01	Uther, I must test your dedication to the Light.
VO_Story_03_Alonsus_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1ExchangeA_01	You have practiced for many years. Few others have been so diligent.
VO_Story_03_Alonsus_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1ExchangeB_01	Stormwind has fallen to the orc Horde. It grieves me to see such times.
VO_Story_03_Alonsus_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1ExchangeC_01	The Alliance needs more than our faith. We must bolster our strength, or it will not survive.
VO_Story_03_Alonsus_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1ExchangeD_01	Magnificent, lad!
VO_Story_03_Alonsus_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1ExchangeE_01	You were chosen by the Light.
VO_Story_03_Alonsus_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1Victory_01	To withstand this war, the church needs a new order of protectors: the paladins.
VO_Story_03_Alonsus_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1Victory_02	You shall be the first of them. I dub thee a Knight of the Silver Hand!
VO_Story_03_Alonsus_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1EmoteResponse_01	You always make me smile, lad.
VO_Story_03_Alonsus_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1HeroPower_01	The Light is our strength.
VO_Story_03_Alonsus_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1HeroPower_02	Light grant me wisdom.
VO_Story_03_Alonsus_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1HeroPower_03	Guided by grace.
VO_Story_03_Alonsus_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1Loss_01	Perhaps you are not ready yet, but I know that, one day, you will be.
VO_Story_03_Alonsus_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1Idle_01	Taking an apprentice has been so rewarding.
VO_Story_03_Alonsus_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1Idle_02	You can lose anything so long as you keep your faith.
VO_Story_03_Alonsus_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission1Idle_03	Sometimes I pray to the Light to see what awaits me, but there is only darkness.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission2Intro_01	The war will not be over until this city falls!
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission2ExchangeC_01	You only delay your fate.
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission2ExchangeF_01	What's this?! My reinforcements are missing… 
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission2ExchangeF_02	Gul'dan has taken them! I knew he would betray me.
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	What are you getting at?
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission2HeroPower_01	Bring me my hammer!
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission2HeroPower_02	Face the Doomhammer!
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission2HeroPower_03	I wield your doom!
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission2Loss_01	Our foes are vanquished! The Horde has triumphed!
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission2Idle_01	The owner of this hammer is prophesied to bring peace. But not today.
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission2Idle_02	We defeated the Alliance in Stormwind. We will defeat you here!
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission2Idle_03	This war will restore glory to the Horde.
	
VO_Story_Minion_Terenas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission2Victory_01	You fought well, paladin.
	
VO_Story_Minion_Turalyon_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission2ExchangeA_01	The other paladins fight alongside you! The Alliance will hold its own!
VO_Story_Minion_Turalyon_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission2ExchangeB_01	Well done! We are pressing them back!
VO_Story_Minion_Turalyon_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission2Victory_01	The day is ours! The Horde has retreated into the hills.
VO_Story_Minion_Turalyon_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission4Intro_01	Unleash everything you have at the portal! But don't let the Horde reinforcements outnumber you!
VO_Story_Minion_Turalyon_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission4ExchangeA_01	There's another world on the other side of that thing. Can you imagine it?
VO_Story_Minion_Turalyon_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission4ExchangeB_01	As soon as the portal is vulnerable, Khadgar can destroy it!
VO_Story_Minion_Turalyon_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission4ExchangeC_01	Be careful, the portal's summons are becoming more powerful!
VO_Story_Minion_Turalyon_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission4Victory_01	At last, we are finally safe.
	
VO_Story_Minion_Varok_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission3Intro_01	You have no advantage here, human.
VO_Story_Minion_Varok_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission3ExchangeA_01	Gul'dan's treachery is not your concern.
VO_Story_Minion_Varok_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission3ExchangeB_01	Your kind is weak and foolish. I pity you.
VO_Story_Minion_Varok_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission3ExchangeC_01	I'll give you one thing. You fight with honor. With conviction.
VO_Story_Minion_Varok_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission3Victory_01	Again, we must retreat. But our day will come. Mark my words.
VO_Story_Minion_Varok_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission3EmoteResponse_01	Diplomacy has never been my strong suit.
VO_Story_Minion_Varok_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission3HeroPower_01	I am war itself.
VO_Story_Minion_Varok_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission3HeroPower_02	Glory to the Blackrock clan!
VO_Story_Minion_Varok_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission3HeroPower_03	Lok'tar ogar!
VO_Story_Minion_Varok_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission3Loss_01	Strength and honor will preserve the Horde forever.
VO_Story_Minion_Varok_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission3Idle_01	I am second only to Warchief Orgrim Doomhammer himself.
VO_Story_Minion_Varok_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission3Idle_02	I have only lost one battle. And I mean to keep it that way.
VO_Story_Minion_Varok_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission3Idle_03	The orcs were peaceful once. It was the Blood Curse that changed us.
	
Story_04_Darkportal_Death	<_crumbling sound_>
Story_04_Darkportal_EmoteResponse	 <_portal noise_>
	
VO_Story_03_Blademaster_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission5Intro_01	I have other uses for them.
VO_Story_03_Blademaster_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission5EmoteResponse_01	You have not seen what we have.
VO_Story_03_Blademaster_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission5HeroPower_01	The warlocks demand sacrifices!
VO_Story_03_Blademaster_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission5HeroPower_02	Embrace the storm!
VO_Story_03_Blademaster_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission5HeroPower_03	My blade seeks vengeance.
VO_Story_03_Blademaster_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission5Loss_01	Every sacrifice strengthens our masters' return…
VO_Story_03_Blademaster_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission5Idle_01	Soon, demons will rain from the sky, and this wretched world will burn!
VO_Story_03_Blademaster_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission5Idle_02	Let this appease our demon masters!
VO_Story_03_Blademaster_Male_Orc_Story_Uther_Mission5Idle_03	We will never surrender.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission5ExchangeA_01	Let's get in there and destroy the beasts!
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission5ExchangeB_01	Slay the orcs! Slay them all!
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission5ExchangeC_01	If I'm already good, why do I have to think?
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission5Victory_01	I don't know, Uther. Those orcs were trying to summon demons…
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission6Intro_01	Uther, your timing couldn't have been better.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission6ExchangeB_01	The Scourge. They started this plague by infecting the villagers' grain. And all who perish join them.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission6ExchangeC_01	Look, I did the best I could, Uther!
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission6Victory_01	We should strike at their leader! I'll go to Stratholme and kill Mal'Ganis myself if I have to!
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission6Victory_02	I'm going. With or without you.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission7Victory_01	We're too late, Uther. These people have all been infected. The city must be purged.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission7Victory_02	Then I must consider this an act of treason. Get out of my sight!
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8Intro_01	Very dramatic, Uther. I'll make sure you die quickly.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8ExchangeA_01	We may never know. I intend to live forever.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8ExchangeB_01	You still might…
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8ExchangeC_01	Perhaps you're a bad teacher.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8EmoteResponse_01	Haven't we talked enough?!
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8Loss_01	Strange, I thought I would feel something at a moment like this.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8Idle_01	You should have obeyed me.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8Idle_02	I will shake the very foundations of the world.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8Idle_03	You were right, Uther. I am vile… even more vile than the orcs.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8HeroPower_01	You will know endless torment.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8HeroPower_02	Frostmourne hungers...
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Uther_Mission8HeroPower_03	Agh!
VO_TB_PrinceHunter_ArthasH_Male_Human_HunterPrince_Victory_01	None can stand between us and our fate...

VO_Story_Hero_Venim_Male_Lich_Story_Uther_Mission6Intro_01	You will freeze together!
VO_Story_Hero_Venim_Male_Lich_Story_Uther_Mission6EmoteResponse_01	I see.
VO_Story_Hero_Venim_Male_Lich_Story_Uther_Mission6HeroPower_01	One by one, they turn.
VO_Story_Hero_Venim_Male_Lich_Story_Uther_Mission6HeroPower_02	All submit sooner or later.
VO_Story_Hero_Venim_Male_Lich_Story_Uther_Mission6HeroPower_03	Mal'Ganis is watching…
VO_Story_Hero_Venim_Male_Lich_Story_Uther_Mission6Loss_01	Curious… he perished sooner than the master planned.
VO_Story_Hero_Venim_Male_Lich_Story_Uther_Mission6Idle_01	You mustn't bother killing me. I've already been through that!
VO_Story_Hero_Venim_Male_Lich_Story_Uther_Mission6Idle_02	The master has great plans for young Arthas.
VO_Story_Hero_Venim_Male_Lich_Story_Uther_Mission6Idle_03	We've infected all of the grain. There is no hope for you.
	
VO_Story_Hero_MalGanis_Male_Demon_Story_Uther_Mission7Intro_01	Arthas abandoned you. Leave him.
VO_Story_Hero_MalGanis_Male_Demon_Story_Uther_Mission7Intro_02	Hahaha...
VO_Story_Hero_MalGanis_Male_Demon_Story_Uther_Mission7ExchangeA_01	Even if you survive the road to Stratholme, your words will never reach him.
VO_Story_Hero_MalGanis_Male_Demon_Story_Uther_Mission7ExchangeB_01	The boy is already lost to you.
VO_Story_Hero_MalGanis_Male_Demon_Story_Uther_Mission7ExchangeC_01	Choke on your pride!
VO_Story_Hero_MalGanis_Male_Demon_Story_Uther_Mission7EmoteResponse_01	Is that all?
VO_Story_Hero_MalGanis_Male_Demon_Story_Uther_Mission7HeroPower_01	We are ETERNAL.
VO_Story_Hero_MalGanis_Male_Demon_Story_Uther_Mission7HeroPower_02	Heed my voice.
VO_Story_Hero_MalGanis_Male_Demon_Story_Uther_Mission7HeroPower_03	Time to settle the score.
VO_Story_Hero_MalGanis_Male_Demon_Story_Uther_Mission7Loss_01	It was always your destiny to fail.
VO_Story_Hero_MalGanis_Male_Demon_Story_Uther_Mission7Idle_01	Haven't you realized this was all part of our plan?
VO_Story_Hero_MalGanis_Male_Demon_Story_Uther_Mission7Idle_02	None may halt the march of the Scourge.
VO_Story_Hero_MalGanis_Male_Demon_Story_Uther_Mission7Idle_03	We will break you and the boy too.

VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Uther_Mission7Victory_03	I'm sorry, Arthas. I can't watch you do this.

VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission1_01	When I was a boy, my father ruled as the King of Stormwind… and I was his most loyal subject.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission1_02	I remember him as the hero of all my stories. He fought dragons to save me. He won every battle.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission1_03	But as I got older, I learned that he couldn't always be the savior I needed.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1Intro_02	Not this again…
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1ExchangeA_02	Every rule has an exception.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1ExchangeB_02	Then why is it so heavy?!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1ExchangeC_01	I just don't know what kind of warrior I could be.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1ExchangeC_03	That's not what I meant.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Threaten_01	Cooler heads will prevail.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Threaten_02	The Light shall burn you!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Attack_01	How's this?
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Attack_02	For the Alliance!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Attack_03	Injustice will not stand.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Attack_03a	Injustice will not stand.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_WellPlayed_01	Well played.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_WellPlayed_01a	Well played.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Greetings_01	Greetings.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Oops_01	Not quite what was planned.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Oops_01a	Not quite what was planned.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Thanks_01	Thank you.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Wow_01	Wow…
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Wow_01a	Wow…
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_LowCards_01	I'm almost out of cards!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_LowCards_01a	I'm almost out of cards!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_NoCards_01	I'm out of cards!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_NoCards_01a	I'm out of cards!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Concede_01	You have bested me.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Concede_01a	You have bested me.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Time_01	I must choose quickly!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Time_01a	I must choose quickly!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_ERROR_GENERIC_01	I can't do that.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Young_ERROR_GENERIC_01	I can't do that.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Error_Full_Minions_01	I don't have room.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Young_ERROR_FULL_MINIONS_01	I don't have room.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission2_01	With the aid of King Magni, I expected to become a mighty warrior, but instead, I was one of few to witness his tragic loss.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission2_02	When his estranged daughter, Moira, arrived to claim his throne, I knew it would drive my father to war.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission2_03	I couldn't let that happen! I turned to my friend Jaina, who had always been there for me.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2Intro_02	Please, we have to prevent my father from attacking Moira.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2ExchangeA_01	I can't. He doesn't know her like I do. She will listen to reason.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2ExchangeB_01	Moira is the rightful heir. She just needs guidance.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2ExchangeC_01	But she just wants peace!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2ExchangeC_03	That's what I've been saying! She needs guidance.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2Victory_02	I do.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission3_01	Thanks to Jaina's aid, I arrived in Ironforge just in time.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission3_02	My father and his SI:7 assassins were almost to the city. I feared for the worst for Moira and her son…
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission3Intro_02	I don't have much time…
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission3ExchangeA_01	I have to pacify Moira's guards before my father arrives!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission3ExchangeB_01	The Dark Iron guards have been imprisoning any who resist her rule.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission3ExchangeC_01	Please! We can resolve this together.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission3Victory_02	Is this what Magni would want? The death of his only daughter?
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission4_01	My father listened to me that day, but not the ones that followed…
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission4_02	For increasingly, I could feel the Light calling to me, drawing me away from the path of a warrior.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission4_03	When I had the chance to train under Velen, I seized it, hoping that one day my father would understand.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission4Intro_02	Nothing would please me more.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission4ExchangeA_02	I wish only to be worthy.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission4ExchangeB_02	Some. I don't think he has seen the Light's purpose for me yet.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission4ExchangeC_02	Like what?
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission4Victory_02	With a teacher like you, I could do no less.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission5_01	I stayed with Velen until the Horde attacked Jaina in Theramore. The loss of her home changed her… and there was nothing I could do to ease her pain.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission5_02	Under Warchief Garrosh's leadership, the Horde became increasingly aggressive.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission5_03	It wasn't long until I had my own encounter with the orcs when I was captured in Pandaria.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission5Intro_02	Sir, I demand to be released to my father's custody!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission5ExchangeA_02	I would greatly prefer you didn't.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission5ExchangeB_01	My father will pay my ransom, I promise! You'd be very wealthy.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission5ExchangeC_02	Oh? What would those be?
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission5Victory_02	And I'll just be going now…
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission6_01	I escaped from the Horde camp, but there was much left for me to do in Pandaria.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission6_02	When I learned the Warchief had obtained a powerful artifact, the Divine Bell, I knew we needed a counter. Fortunately, legends revealed one: the Harmonic Mallet.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission6_03	But it was hidden away by a strange creature called the Monkey King… and he himself had been imprisoned for many years.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission6Intro_01	I'll try to free him… Here goes nothing!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission6ExchangeA_02	Thank you, but this is hardly the time. 
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission6ExchangeA_03	A dangerous war leader has found the Divine Bell. We need the Harmonic Mallet to stop him.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission6Victory_02	Ah, great. More work.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission7_01	Just as I finished getting the pieces of the Harmonic Mallet, Horde warriors began to gather at an ancient mogu palace.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission7_02	It could only mean one thing—the Warchief was preparing to use the Divine Bell. Armed with the mallet, I went to intervene.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission7Victory_01	Agh!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission7Victory_03	D… did I do it? Is the bell destroyed? Good.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission8_01	I recovered under my father's care. In time, Garrosh was made to atone for his crimes.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission8_02	Then the unthinkable happened… my father fell in battle. I learned to rule in his stead as I grieved for him.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_PreMission8_03	And all the while, a darkness festered within the Horde… an evil beyond redemption… Sylvanas Windrunner. I would need everything I had learned to confront her.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission8Intro_01	It is over, Sylvanas! 
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeA_02	Bring it down!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeD_02	Alliance, hold your ground!
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeE_02	This isn't your war, Saurfang…
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeE_04	There is no honor in killing him. Take him away.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeF_02	You don't deserve to speak his name.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeG_02	I was forged. You were cursed.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission8Victory_01	We defeated Sylvanas and weakened the Horde, though our victory came at great cost.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission8Victory_02	In my heart, I knew that I'd found my warrior's spirit, despite my pledge to peace.
VO_Story_Hero_Anduin_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission8Victory_03	When I was young, my father always saved me. And nothing has changed.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1Intro_01	It's time I saw to your training, my son.
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1ExchangeA_01	There are many great warriors in our family. You will be another.
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1ExchangeB_01	Take up your sword, Anduin. You were meant to hold one.
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1ExchangeC_02	Ah, you have so many options! Arms, fury, protection…
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1Victory_01	All right. I think it would be best if you trained with someone else.
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1Victory_02	The dwarves might be able to show you what I cannot. Their strength is truly something to behold. 
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1EmoteResponse_01	We can talk later, Anduin.
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1HeroPower_01	Focus!
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1HeroPower_02	Put your heart into it.
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1HeroPower_03	You must try harder.
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1Loss_01	We can train again as soon as you are ready. I'm always here for you.
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1Idle_01	You take after your mother, don't you? If only she were still with us.
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1Idle_02	Our family has many enemies. I need you to be ready when they strike.
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission1Idle_03	A gentle heart cannot win wars.
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission3ExchangeC_01	Behold the usurper!
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission3ExchangeD_01	Anduin, listen to me. Thaurissan ensorcelled Moira and turned her against her people.
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission3Victory_02	No. She may rule, but not alone. Form a council between the three clans. And do not disappoint me.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2Intro_01	Anduin, what are you doing here?
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2Intro_03	It's best you stay out of this one. 
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2ExchangeA_02	Are you sure about that?
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2ExchangeB_02	The time for that passed long ago. She's with the Dark Iron dwarves—our enemies.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2ExchangeC_02	She's not off to a very good start, then.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2Victory_01	You're right… You have to stop your father. But you'd better make it worth the risk, do you understand?
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2Victory_02	And here, you'll need to dress the part.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	Can't we put this behind us and have a nice cup of tea?
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2HeroPower_01	You're still learning.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2HeroPower_02	Your father wouldn't like this!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2HeroPower_03	Don't be so reckless!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2Loss_01	I'm sorry, Anduin. You'll be safer this way.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2Idle_01	I sympathize with you, truly, but dwarven politics are just…
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2Idle_02	If only King Magni were still here to tell us what he wants us to do.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission2Idle_03	If Moira wants reconciliation, why has she closed off the city of Ironforge?
VO_Story_Minion_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeC_02	The Horde will pay for its crimes!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Moira_Female_Dwarf_Story_Anduin_Mission3Intro_01	Find the intruders!
VO_Story_Hero_Moira_Female_Dwarf_Story_Anduin_Mission3ExchangeC_02	I am the king's sole heir, whether ye like it or not.
VO_Story_Hero_Moira_Female_Dwarf_Story_Anduin_Mission3ExchangeD_02	My husband did no such thing! And yet, my father's forces still killed him.
VO_Story_Hero_Moira_Female_Dwarf_Story_Anduin_Mission3EmoteResponse_01	What great friends we could've been…
VO_Story_Hero_Moira_Female_Dwarf_Story_Anduin_Mission3HeroPower_01	Hold yer tongue!
VO_Story_Hero_Moira_Female_Dwarf_Story_Anduin_Mission3HeroPower_02	Obey the queen.
VO_Story_Hero_Moira_Female_Dwarf_Story_Anduin_Mission3HeroPower_03	Ironforge is mine.
VO_Story_Hero_Moira_Female_Dwarf_Story_Anduin_Mission3Loss_01	And here I thought my coronation would be a day of joy…
VO_Story_Hero_Moira_Female_Dwarf_Story_Anduin_Mission3Idle_01	Of course these fools don't accept me. My own father didn't either.
VO_Story_Hero_Moira_Female_Dwarf_Story_Anduin_Mission3Idle_02	My son will bring unity between the Bronzebeards and the Dark Irons.
VO_Story_Hero_Moira_Female_Dwarf_Story_Anduin_Mission3Idle_03	People tell lies about me because they don't wannae understand the truth.
	
VO_Story_Minion_Rohan_Male_Dwarf_TriggerHeal_01	The Light is strong in ye, laddie.
VO_Story_Minion_Rohan_Male_Dwarf_TriggerAnduin_01	Listen tae the lad!
VO_Story_Minion_Rohan_Male_Dwarf_TriggerMoira_01	Say yer prayers.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Velen_Male_Draenei_Story_Anduin_Mission4Intro_01	Let us continue your studies, young prince.
VO_Story_Hero_Velen_Male_Draenei_Story_Anduin_Mission4ExchangeA_01	It is so rare to see one as you—truly blessed by the Light.
VO_Story_Hero_Velen_Male_Draenei_Story_Anduin_Mission4ExchangeB_01	Have you had word from your father?
VO_Story_Hero_Velen_Male_Draenei_Story_Anduin_Mission4ExchangeB_03	He will.
VO_Story_Hero_Velen_Male_Draenei_Story_Anduin_Mission4ExchangeC_01	The Light has so much in store for you.
VO_Story_Hero_Velen_Male_Draenei_Story_Anduin_Mission4ExchangeC_03	I cannot see it all, only that you are essential.
VO_Story_Hero_Velen_Male_Draenei_Story_Anduin_Mission4Victory_01	I know your father's hesitance weighs on you, but you have made the right choice. 
VO_Story_Hero_Velen_Male_Draenei_Story_Anduin_Mission4Victory_02	Few priests have ascended so quickly.
VO_Story_Hero_Velen_Male_Draenei_Story_Anduin_Mission4EmoteResponse_01	A curious observation.
VO_Story_Hero_Velen_Male_Draenei_Story_Anduin_Mission4HeroPower_01	The Light flows…
VO_Story_Hero_Velen_Male_Draenei_Story_Anduin_Mission4HeroPower_02	Be as one…
VO_Story_Hero_Velen_Male_Draenei_Story_Anduin_Mission4HeroPower_03	United in the Light!
VO_Story_Hero_Velen_Male_Draenei_Story_Anduin_Mission4Loss_01	Do not be discouraged, Anduin. This is only the start of your journey.
VO_Story_Hero_Velen_Male_Draenei_Story_Anduin_Mission4Idle_01	I hope you have enjoyed your time here in Exodar. Stormwind may seem strange to you now.
VO_Story_Hero_Velen_Male_Draenei_Story_Anduin_Mission4Idle_02	Our people do not easily understand each other, but together, we will empower the Alliance.
VO_Story_Hero_Velen_Male_Draenei_Story_Anduin_Mission4Idle_03	I will always be here to counsel you.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Nazgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission5Intro_01	What's this? An Alliance boy? Here? Wait, I know your face—the son of Varian Wrynn!
VO_Story_Hero_Nazgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission5ExchangeA_01	Hah! Make another demand, princeling, and I'll release your head from your shoulders!
VO_Story_Hero_Nazgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission5ExchangeB_03	Wealth is for weaklings.
VO_Story_Hero_Nazgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission5ExchangeC_01	You waste my time! I have other matters to attend to… things to search for…
VO_Story_Hero_Nazgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission5ExchangeC_03	Nothing I'd tell Alliance scum!
VO_Story_Hero_Nazgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission5_Victory_02	Then the time for war is at hand! Gather the recruits. We march against the Alliance.
VO_Story_Hero_Nazgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission5EmoteResponse_01	Is this a ruse?
VO_Story_Hero_Nazgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission5HeroPower_01	Stay put!
VO_Story_Hero_Nazgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission5HeroPower_02	No escaping!
VO_Story_Hero_Nazgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission5HeroPower_03	Not on my watch.
VO_Story_Hero_Nazgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission5Loss_01	I had planned to return him alive, but this will do.
VO_Story_Hero_Nazgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission5Idle_01	The Warchief told me to take Pandaria for the Horde. Why else would I be here training monkeys?
VO_Story_Hero_Nazgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission5Idle_02	I swear, the Alliance are even more trouble than these hozen.
VO_Story_Hero_Nazgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission5Idle_03	Garrosh believes there are valuable treasures hidden in this land… Treasures that could crush our foes.
	
VO_Story_Minion_HordeAdventurer_Female_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission5_Victory_01	The reports are complete, General.
	
VO_Story_Hero_MonkeyKing_Male_Hozen_Story_Anduin_Mission6Intro_02	Iiiiiiiiii'm back Wikkets!
VO_Story_Hero_MonkeyKing_Male_Hozen_Story_Anduin_Mission6ExchangeA_01	You saved me from an eternity trapped in jade! I'm gonna throw you the biggest party ever made!
VO_Story_Hero_MonkeyKing_Male_Hozen_Story_Anduin_Mission6ExchangeB_01	Three riddles I will ask. These riddles are a task. Finish each without pause, then I will help your cause.
VO_Story_Hero_MonkeyKing_Male_Hozen_Story_Anduin_Mission6ExchangeC_01	Seek out the creature sad and somber, and free it from its untamed amber.
VO_Story_Hero_MonkeyKing_Male_Hozen_Story_Anduin_Mission6ExchangeD_01	Bring to me a metal brew, then I will share the mallet with you.
VO_Story_Hero_MonkeyKing_Male_Hozen_Story_Anduin_Mission6ExchangeE_01	A test of strength the Monkey King will require, before you receive this tool of your desire.
VO_Story_Hero_MonkeyKing_Male_Hozen_Story_Anduin_Mission6_Victory_01	Mogu are not bright, they fail to see things for what they are. 
VO_Story_Hero_MonkeyKing_Male_Hozen_Story_Anduin_Mission6_Victory_03	The Monkey King broke the mallet and sent the pieces afar.
VO_Story_Hero_MonkeyKing_Male_Hozen_Story_Anduin_Mission6_Victory_02	The head, the handle, these two must be made as one. 
VO_Story_Hero_MonkeyKing_Male_Hozen_Story_Anduin_Mission6_Victory_04	Combined with evil's ointment, the bell's evil can be undone.
VO_Story_Hero_MonkeyKing_Male_Hozen_Story_Anduin_Mission6EmoteResponse_01	Don't be boring or I'll start snoring!
VO_Story_Hero_MonkeyKing_Male_Hozen_Story_Anduin_Mission6HeroPower_01	Ugh!
VO_Story_Hero_MonkeyKing_Male_Hozen_Story_Anduin_Mission6HeroPower_02	Oooo!
VO_Story_Hero_MonkeyKing_Male_Hozen_Story_Anduin_Mission6HeroPower_03	Aaa!
VO_Story_Hero_MonkeyKing_Male_Hozen_Story_Anduin_Mission6Loss_01	Take some care, little thing. You deal with the Monkey King!
VO_Story_Hero_MonkeyKing_Male_Hozen_Story_Anduin_Mission6Idle_01	The Divine Bell was made for the Thunder King, but it should've belonged to the Monkey King!
VO_Story_Hero_MonkeyKing_Male_Hozen_Story_Anduin_Mission6Idle_02	Mogu are fools who love to fight, but clever hozen party every night!
VO_Story_Hero_MonkeyKing_Male_Hozen_Story_Anduin_Mission6Idle_03	It's more fun to speak in verse, even though you can't be terse.
	
VO_Story_Minion_SamtheWise_Male_Pandaren_TriggerDone_01	Enjoy this well-earned brew.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission7EmoteResponse_01	Your head is as empty as your father's.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission7HeroPower_01	Let the song of victory begin!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission7HeroPower_02	Our suffering will end!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission7HeroPower_03	The Horde will prevail!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission7Loss_01	Now Varian will know the price for his continued defiance…
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission7Idle_01	When this war is won, my people will see prosperity at last.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission7Idle_02	Your interference has cost me great warriors, young prince. You'll pay with your life.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission7Idle_03	With the power of the bell on our side, the Horde will be unstoppable.
	
VO_Story_Minion_Genn_Male_Worgen_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeA_01	I've never seen anything like that war machine…
VO_Story_Minion_Genn_Male_Worgen_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeC_01	My king… we cannot endure.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Anduin_Mission8Intro_02	You have no idea what you're up against. We've only just begun!
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeB_01	Let the Blight rain upon our enemies!
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeB_03	SILENCE!
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeD_01	Darkspear, to arms!
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeE_01	Cover our retreat, High Overlord.
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeF_01	You wield your father's sword. Are you trying to make him proud? 
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeG_01	You claim you fight for peace… but we are both of us forged by war.
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeH_01	You've won… nothing.
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Anduin_Mission8EmoteResponse_01	Enough meddling!
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Anduin_Mission8HeroPower_01	Suffer well.
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Anduin_Mission8HeroPower_02	Abandon hope.
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Anduin_Mission8HeroPower_03	Destroy them!
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Anduin_Mission8Loss_01	Do not fret… You won't be dead for long…
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Anduin_Mission8Idle_01	Your whole life devoted to peace, and one little tree brings you to battle.
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Anduin_Mission8Idle_02	How much will you sacrifice today, boy king?
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Anduin_Mission8Idle_03	All of your most loyal friends are here with you. A pity if you lost some…
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_TriggerAlleria_01	Greetings, sister.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Varok_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeB_02	There must be another way…
VO_Story_Hero_Varok_Male_Orc_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeE_03	MY LIFE FOR THE HORDE!
VO_Story_Hero_Saurfang_Male_Orc_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Idle_02	There is nothing without honor. I must never forget that.
VO_Story_Hero_Saurfang_Male_Orc_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Idle_03	Even I do not know how far our Warchief will go in this war. 

VO_Story_Minion_Nathanos_Male_Undead_Story_Anduin_Mission8ExchangeD_02	Your time is up, King Anduin!
VO_Story_Minion_Nathanos_Male_Undead_Trigger_01	It is you who is outnumbered now.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission1_01	How would you define yourself? Would you look to your people, your country, your faction…? What if you'd lost all of them?
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission1_02	My parents died when I was young. When I left my homeland, I was captured and imprisoned.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission1_03	Later, I learned I was headed for the arenas of Kalimdor…
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission1Intro_02	That's encouraging.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission1ExchangeA_02	We could just duel each other, old man.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission1ExchangeB_01	And who's the amnesiac?
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission1ExchangeB_03	At least you're pretty good.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission1ExchangeC_03	Broll can't be serious, can he?
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission1Victory_01	I can't wait.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Threaten_01	Are you trying to make me angry? It's working.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission2_01	Despite my doubts, Rehgar's instincts proved correct. We became a winning team, defying all expectations…
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission2_02	But soon after, I was sold to another gladiator trainer. Mostly I was just angry, yet… I think I missed the others.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission2_03	All of their stupid banter had grown on me, though I hated to admit it. And I was ready to be free.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission2Intro_01	Don't make me laugh. I'm a champion, you know.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission2ExchangeA_01	Is this what passes for a gladiator in Thunder Bluff?
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission2ExchangeB_01	There's no one here who could actually challenge me.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission2ExchangeC_02	I have that effect on people.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission2Victory_01	Well, that was thrilling. I'm definitely going to stick around for more of this gladiator fighting business.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission2Victory_03	No, I'm not. Bye now!
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission3_01	After I was free, I set out to find Broll and Lo'Gosh. I had a feeling they'd already gotten into trouble.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission3_02	And it was worse than I thought—an assassin from Stormwind was tracking them. Since they were totally oblivious, it became my mess to clean up…
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission3Intro_02	Ah, but I do. So you'll have to deal with me.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission3ExchangeA_02	Let's just say you're not very good at your trade.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission3ExchangeB_01	Who sent you after Lo'Gosh?
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission3ExchangeC_03	If this is all it takes to be an assassin, maybe I should try it.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission3Victory_01	All right, this is the last time I'm asking! Who sent you?
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission3Victory_03	Have it your way.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission4_01	As it turned out, the assassin was after Lo'Gosh because he was actually Varian Wrynn, King of Stormwind.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission4_02	When our group reunited, Broll and I pledged to accompany the king back to his home. But we were quickly intercepted.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission4_03	Whoever was after Varian was not content to send just one assassin, and the next would scar me deeply…
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4Intro_03	You'd think we'd be used to it by now.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4ExchangeA_02	We have nothing in common, warlock.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4ExchangeC_01	At least we get to fight as a team again.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4ExchangeC_03	Shut up.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4Victory_02	Ahh!
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4Victory_05	I'm… trying…
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission5_01	With great effort, and Broll's medicines, I was able to subdue the demon inside me.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission5_02	Returning to Stormwind, we helped Varian reclaim his throne and resume his diplomatic work.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission5_03	Jaina Proudmoore invited him to a meeting with the Horde leaders in Theramore, but we were soon ambushed… 
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission5Intro_02	Varian, on your guard!
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission5ExchangeA_02	It could be a coincidence… maybe?
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission5ExchangeD_02	Don't you dare! 
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission5Victory_01	I regret that this meeting was a failure, Lady Proudmoore.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission5Victory_03	She probably just knows how to make me angry.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission6_01	But I was curious about the half-orc we captured—Garona. There was something strange about her… 
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission6_02	She seemed conflicted—as if she hadn't been in control of her own actions. I needed to know more.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission6Intro_01	You're our prisoner now. It's time to talk.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission6ExchangeA_01	Lucky for you, I have experience with amnesiacs.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission6ExchangeC_02	It's sorcery. Cooperate with us, and Jaina will break the spell.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission6Victory_02	Done. Jaina, this is your moment.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission7_01	I'd gone against enough opponents to know better than taking on the entire demented Twilight's Hammer cult by myself.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission7_02	Jaina's ally, Meryl Winterstorm, agreed to help me. Together, we teleported into that cursed desert…
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission7Intro_01	Wait… we have to fight THAT?
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission7ExchangeB_02	Uh… let's not talk about that.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission7ExchangeC_02	It's getting harder to control!
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission7ExchangeD_01	My strength is gone. I have to do this, Meryl… I have to draw on the demon's power!
VO_Story_Hero_ValeeraDemon_Female_Demon_Story_Valeera_Mission7ExchangeE_01	I am unleashed!
VO_Story_Hero_ValeeraDemon_Female_Demon_Story_Valeera_Mission7ExchangeE_03	Does it now?
VO_Story_Hero_ValeeraDemon_Female_Demon_Story_Valeera_Mission7Victory_02	You are one of the Tirisfalen… I accept your offer.
VO_Story_Hero_ValeeraDemon_Female_Demon_WellPlayed_01	<_evil demonic laugh_>
VO_Story_Hero_ValeeraDemon_Female_Demon_Wow_01	Ah…!
VO_Story_Hero_ValeeraDemon_Female_Demon_LowCards_01	I am low on cards.
VO_Story_Hero_ValeeraDemon_Female_Demon_NoCards_01	Out of cards!
VO_Story_Hero_ValeeraDemon_Female_Demon_Threaten_01	Long have I waited for this moment!
VO_Story_Hero_ValeeraDemon_Female_Demon_Concede_01	Embrace the end!
VO_Story_Hero_ValeeraDemon_Female_Demon_Time_01	Be swift.
VO_Story_Hero_ValeeraDemon_Female_Demon_Error_Generic_01	No.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission7Victory_03	Meryl! Will you be all right?
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission8_01	Afterward, I accepted Varian's offer to reside in Stormwind—to have a home, even if some residents looked upon me with fear. 
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission8_02	In return, I served him from the shadows whenever I was needed. My one mistake was not accompanying him to the Broken Shore, where he met his end… 
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_PreMission8_03	I was more careful than ever to keep an eye on Anduin and any potential enemies that could rise against him.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission8Intro_01	Why have you called me here, Lord Ravenholdt?
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission8ExchangeA_02	The only weakness is your accusations!
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission8ExchangeC_01	What's the meaning of this? What's been going on in this mansion of yours?
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission8Victory_02	The what?
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission8Victory_04	And just like that, I found my place, my people, my faction.
VO_Story_Hero_Valeera_Female_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission8Victory_05	Those invisible and unremembered, whose wills have nonetheless shaped the fortunes of all.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission1Intro_01	You three do not look like much, but soon you will be gladiators. Training begins now! You win or you die.
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission1ExchangeC_01	You must work together if you want to see another day.
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission1Victory_01	I knew it. You are the ideal team—powerful, strategic, and unrestrained. Now your real battle begins.
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission1EmoteResponse_01	I am training you for battle, not prattle.
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission1HeroPower_01	Be prepared for anything!
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission1HeroPower_02	Expect the unexpected.
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission1HeroPower_03	Try to improvise…
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission1Loss_01	Maybe I should have stuck with training orcs…
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission1Idle_01	Even if you lose, you will still taste the glory of the arena!
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission1Idle_02	Dark magic lingers on that human. I wonder what happened to him?
VO_Story_Hero_Rehgar_Male_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission1Idle_03	Broll is here of his own free will. It seems he has no other outlet for his anger.
	
VO_Story_Minion_Broll_Male_NightElf_Story_Valeera_Mission1ExchangeA_01	Rehgar, you cannot ask me to fight alongside a blood elf!
VO_Story_Minion_Broll_Male_NightElf_Story_Valeera_Mission1ExchangeA_03	Don't tempt me.
VO_Story_Minion_Broll_Male_NightElf_Story_Valeera_Mission1ExchangeC_02	Rehgar is right. We balance each other well.
VO_Story_Minion_Broll_Male_NightElf_Play_01	Mine is the strength of the wild.
VO_Story_Minion_Broll_Male_NightElf_Attack_01	I am nature's rage!
VO_Story_Minion_Broll_Male_NightElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4Intro_02	Just when we were making some progress…
VO_Story_Minion_Broll_Male_NightElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4ExchangeB_01	What did you do as king to make so many enemies?
VO_Story_Minion_Broll_Male_NightElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4ExchangeC_03	Shut up.
VO_Story_Minion_Broll_Male_NightElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4Victory_03	Valeera! He's cursed you…
	
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission1ExchangeB_02	I… don't know.
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission1ExchangeC_04	I think he is.
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission4ExchangeB_02	Good question. I can't recall…
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission4ExchangeC_02	I missed your bickering.
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission4Victory_04	Fight it with all you have!
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission5ExchangeA_01	We came here to meet with the Horde, and now other Horde members attack us!
VO_Story_Hero_Varian_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission5ExchangeC_02	There is no point. They have broken our trust!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Helka_Female_Tauren_Story_Valeera_Mission2Intro_01	Show me how well you fight on your own, blood elf.
VO_Story_Hero_Helka_Female_Tauren_Story_Valeera_Mission2ExchangeA_02	Less talking and more fighting!
VO_Story_Hero_Helka_Female_Tauren_Story_Valeera_Mission2ExchangeB_02	We shall see about that.
VO_Story_Hero_Helka_Female_Tauren_Story_Valeera_Mission2ExchangeC_01	Rehgar vouched for you, but even I did not expect you to be so skillful.
VO_Story_Hero_Helka_Female_Tauren_Story_Valeera_Mission2Victory_02	Really?
VO_Story_Hero_Helka_Female_Tauren_Story_Valeera_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	Why are you elves always so mouthy?
VO_Story_Hero_Helka_Female_Tauren_Story_Valeera_Mission2HeroPower_01	Time for a new trainee!
VO_Story_Hero_Helka_Female_Tauren_Story_Valeera_Mission2HeroPower_02	Face this!
VO_Story_Hero_Helka_Female_Tauren_Story_Valeera_Mission2HeroPower_03	Fight to the end!
VO_Story_Hero_Helka_Female_Tauren_Story_Valeera_Mission2Loss_01	I had such high hopes for you… What a pity.
VO_Story_Hero_Helka_Female_Tauren_Story_Valeera_Mission2Idle_01	Something is amiss. Do you regret being separated from your team?
VO_Story_Hero_Helka_Female_Tauren_Story_Valeera_Mission2Idle_02	There are not many blood elves here in Kalimdor. You are most unusual.
VO_Story_Hero_Helka_Female_Tauren_Story_Valeera_Mission2Idle_03	Skilled assassins are always welcome among the Grimtotems.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Daerion_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission3Intro_01	Perfect. My target suspects nothing…
VO_Story_Hero_Daerion_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission3Death_01	Agh!
VO_Story_Hero_Daerion_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission3ExchangeA_01	How do you know who I am?!
VO_Story_Hero_Daerion_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission3ExchangeB_02	Is that what you call him? Hahaha.
VO_Story_Hero_Daerion_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission3Victory_02	A member of the guild never reveals his secrets.
VO_Story_Hero_Daerion_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission3EmoteResponse_01	Are you trying to trick me?
VO_Story_Hero_Daerion_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission3HeroPower_01	No one can know I'm here!
VO_Story_Hero_Daerion_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission3HeroPower_02	You'll regret this!
VO_Story_Hero_Daerion_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission3HeroPower_03	Your meddling will be the end of you!
VO_Story_Hero_Daerion_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission3Loss_01	Now to finish my job… The man calling himself Lo'Gosh is near.
VO_Story_Hero_Daerion_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission3Idle_01	I don't know how you tracked me, but I can't let you ruin my mission.
VO_Story_Hero_Daerion_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission3Idle_02	You have no clue what you're getting into. This goes way further than me…
VO_Story_Hero_Daerion_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission3Idle_03	It seems that your friend is hiding a lot from you.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Vendellin_Male_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4Intro_01	Your journey ends here!
VO_Story_Hero_Vendellin_Male_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4Death_01	Agh!
VO_Story_Hero_Vendellin_Male_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4ExchangeA_01	Ah, I didn't expect another blood elf…
VO_Story_Hero_Vendellin_Male_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4Victory_01	Here is a parting gift, sin'dorei. A taste of fel…
VO_Story_Hero_Vendellin_Male_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4EmoteResponse_01	You cannot distract me.
VO_Story_Hero_Vendellin_Male_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4HeroPower_01	Revel in darkness!
VO_Story_Hero_Vendellin_Male_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4HeroPower_02	Corruption washes over all.
VO_Story_Hero_Vendellin_Male_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4HeroPower_03	Fel is the true power.
VO_Story_Hero_Vendellin_Male_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4Loss_01	Hah, that was so effective, I should request a raise!
VO_Story_Hero_Vendellin_Male_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4Idle_01	How strange to encounter a blood elf who hasn't yet been corrupted.
VO_Story_Hero_Vendellin_Male_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4Idle_02	Our kind are woefully susceptible to the arcane, so I skipped straight to fel energy!
VO_Story_Hero_Vendellin_Male_BloodElf_Story_Valeera_Mission4Idle_03	Have you ever considered having a demon of your own? Other than your terrible incompetence, I mean.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission5ExchangeD_01	You'll meet your father's fate, King of Stormwind.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission6Intro_02	Please… I don't remember what happened.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission6ExchangeA_02	Not like this!
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission6ExchangeB_01	Everything is a blur… like my past is not my own.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission6ExchangeC_01	I can't recall anything else. You have to believe me!
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission6Victory_01	All right… I will try to remember.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission6Victory_04	I can handle it.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission6Victory_05	The Twilight's Hammer… in Ahn'Qiraj sent me… to kill Varian.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission6EmoteResponse_01	You're confusing me.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission6HeroPower_01	Stop! Leave me!
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission6HeroPower_02	Too much is at stake!
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission6HeroPower_03	I can't do it… I can't!
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission6Loss_01	It's awful… she didn't seem like an enemy. But I have much yet to do.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission6Idle_01	You're good with a blade, just like me. But I doubt you had to make the same sacrifices.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission6Idle_02	I never asked for any of this. I've been a pawn in a greater game.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission6Idle_03	Part of me wants to remember… yet the fear is overwhelming.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Play_01	I know what I must do…
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Attack_01	My knives are ready!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission5ExchangeC_01	Please, everyone stay calm! We can defeat her and figure out what really happened here.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission5Victory_02	We took one of the attackers prisoner. Maybe she knows something?
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission6Victory_03	I'll try my best... but it's very dangerous.
	
VO_Story_Minion_Meryl_Male_Undead_Story_Valeera_Mission7Intro_02	I thought he was dead…
VO_Story_Minion_Meryl_Male_Undead_Story_Valeera_Mission7ExchangeC_01	The demon within you is restless, Valeera.
VO_Story_Minion_Meryl_Male_Undead_Story_Valeera_Mission7ExchangeD_02	Valeera, no!
VO_Story_Minion_Meryl_Male_Undead_Story_Valeera_Mission7Victory_01	We've driven Cho'Gall back! Now, demon, come to me. Am I not the worthier host?
VO_Story_Minion_Meryl_Male_Undead_Story_Valeera_Mission7Victory_04	Yes. For you to be safe, I will bear this burden.
	
VO_Story_Hero_ChoGall_Male_Ogre_Story_Valeera_Mission7Intro_03	Hahahahaha!
VO_Story_Hero_ChoGall_Male_Ogre_Story_Valeera_Mission7Death_01	Aaa!
VO_Story_Hero_ChoGall_Male_Ogre_Story_Valeera_Mission7ExchangeB_01	You are truly pathetic, elf. But there is a greater power within you!
VO_Story_Hero_ChoGall_Male_Ogre_Story_Valeera_Mission7ExchangeE_02	Ah, but your might still pales before ours…
VO_Story_Hero_ChoGall_Male_Ogre_Story_Valeera_Mission7EmoteResponse_01	Your words are empty.
VO_Story_Hero_ChoGall_Male_Ogre_Story_Valeera_Mission7Loss_01	The master's return proceeds according to plan… All shall be chaos and ash!
VO_Story_Hero_ChoGall_Male_Ogre_Story_Valeera_Mission7Idle_01	My power will be the key that unlocks C'Thun's return…
VO_Story_Hero_ChoGall_Male_Ogre_Story_Valeera_Mission7Idle_02	Whatever the master desires, he shall have…
VO_Story_Hero_ChoGall_Male_Ogre_Story_Valeera_Mission7Idle_03	You cannot unravel our work. It has only just begun.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Jorach_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission8Intro_02	To experience the greatest test of your life, of course.
VO_Story_Hero_Jorach_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission8ExchangeA_01	Can you still strike swiftly from the darkness? Or have your years in Stormwind made you weak?
VO_Story_Hero_Jorach_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission8ExchangeB_01	I see you haven't abandoned your training. Very good.
VO_Story_Hero_Jorach_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission8ExchangeC_02	An excellent question, and one I will answer, should you succeed.
VO_Story_Hero_Jorach_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission8Victory_01	You have passed. I name you one of the Uncrowned, should you wish to bear it.
VO_Story_Hero_Jorach_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission8Victory_03	The Uncrowned. Slayers of kings, downfall of empires, the unseen blades that write the true history of the world.
VO_Story_Hero_Jorach_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission8Death_01	<_pained exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_Jorach_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission8EmoteResponse_01	All will be clear soon.
VO_Story_Hero_Jorach_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission8Loss_01	You were such a promising candidate…
VO_Story_Hero_Jorach_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission8Idle_01	It took some digging, but I discovered all you have done for the late king…
VO_Story_Hero_Jorach_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission8Idle_02	Are you truly loyal to Anduin? Or merely the memory of his father?
VO_Story_Hero_Jorach_Male_Human_Story_Valeera_Mission8Idle_03	Ravenholdt Manor is a den of secrets. Could you help us keep them?
	
VO_Story_Hero_Stasia_Female_Undead_Story_Valeera_Mission5Intro_01	Strike them down!
VO_Story_Hero_Stasia_Female_Undead_Story_Valeera_Mission5Death_01	Aaaah!
VO_Story_Hero_Stasia_Female_Undead_Story_Valeera_Mission5EmoteResponse_01	Silence!
VO_Story_Hero_Stasia_Female_Undead_Story_Valeera_Mission5HeroPower_01	Fight amongst yourselves…
VO_Story_Hero_Stasia_Female_Undead_Story_Valeera_Mission5HeroPower_02	Everyone is against you.
VO_Story_Hero_Stasia_Female_Undead_Story_Valeera_Mission5HeroPower_03	No one is on your side.
VO_Story_Hero_Stasia_Female_Undead_Story_Valeera_Mission5Loss_01	All has fallen into place. The master will be pleased to hear it…
VO_Story_Hero_Stasia_Female_Undead_Story_Valeera_Mission5Idle_01	Do you hear the whispering? Twilight comes…
VO_Story_Hero_Stasia_Female_Undead_Story_Valeera_Mission5Idle_02	Darkness is the only future that awaits you.
VO_Story_Hero_Stasia_Female_Undead_Story_Valeera_Mission5Idle_03	Shatter the peace… embrace the shards of chaos…
	
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission5ExchangeA_01	These are not my warriors!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission5ExchangeA_03	I am sorry, Jaina. It was a worthy effort.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Valeera_Mission5ExchangeA_02	Hiring undead assassins sounds like an Alliance ruse to me. It is time we left!

VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission1_01	Early in my life, I did not know who I truly was… or who my people were.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission1_02	Everything around me was defined by others—like my master, the Alliance lord, Blackmoore. 
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission1_03	When he bade me to eat, I ate… to sleep? I slept… And to fight? I fought with all my heart.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission1Intro_02	Yes, master.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission1ExchangeC_02	If I don't keep fighting, Blackmoore won't be pleased…
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission1Victory_02	Yes, master.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission1Victory_04	I did my best, and it still was not enough for him. You may be right…
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Threaten_02	Is that all?
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Attack_02	<_attack exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Greetings_02	Greetings.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Concede_02	I shall stand down.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_ERROR_GENERIC_01	I can't do that.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_ERROR_HAND_FULL_01	There isn't room.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_LowCards_01	I'm almost out of cards!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_NoCards_01	I'm out of cards.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Oops_01	That was a mistake.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Thanks_01	I thank you.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Time_01	There is little time.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_WellPlayed_01	Well played.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Wow_01	That's incredible.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission2_01	With Taretha's aid, I managed to leave, although she paid dearly for helping me.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission2_02	Despite that, I reconnected with my people and discovered my true heritage. I learned I was the son of the late Durotan, leader of the Frostwolf Clan.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission2_03	His shaman, Drek'Thar, had survived the wars, and he began teaching me the ways of the elements.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2Intro_02	I am ready.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2ExchangeA_02	I… do not know.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2ExchangeA_04	I ask for strength and power against my foes.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2ExchangeB_02	Give swiftness and stamina to me and my allies. Ensure we never tire in battle!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2ExchangeC_03	Burn through my enemies! Never let my courage fail!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2ExchangeD_03	To heal my wounds and replenish my strength.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2ExchangeE_03	Preserve my connection to all living things—a power beyond words.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2Victory_02	I thought I would feel so mighty… but instead, I am humbled.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission3_01	My days with Drek'Thar and the Frostwolf Clan passed peacefully. But I heard tales of an orc warrior who had never been captured—Grommash Hellscream.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission3_02	I wanted to join him in liberating the rest of our people. However, a mysterious stranger insisted on opposing me…
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3Intro_02	I was raised by humans! We know things they do not. We must not be bound by fear!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3ExchangeA_01	I will not be silent!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3ExchangeB_02	So long as one orc is in danger, we all are!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3ExchangeC_01	Our people must be free!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3Victory_02	Second? But… I beat you, stranger.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission4_01	It was a test, and I had passed. Together, the Warchief and I fought to free our people.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission4_02	When he fell in battle, he charged me to take up his place—and his hammer. Once the orcs were liberated, we sailed to Kalimdor to begin anew.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission4_03	But I realized the orcs had more than one master. With one gone, another came to claim us… the demons.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission4Intro_02	Your hold on him ends now!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission4ExchangeC_02	It matters not. I helped my people escape from the camps, and I will help them escape from you!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission4Victory_01	You have freed yourself, old friend… You've freed us all.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission5_01	Though Mannoroth fell, his commander, Archimonde, remained set on invading our world.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission5_02	In the face of this threat, I agreed to work alongside humans led by Jaina Proudmoore and night elves led by Tyrande Whisperwind.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission5_03	Overcoming our hatred was the only way we could embrace victory.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission5Intro_03	Ours is a bold plan, but it is all we have.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission5ExchangeG_01	My allies have arrived!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission6_01	Our triumph heralded a new era. As Warchief, I kept peace with the Alliance, while listening to the many voices within the Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission6_02	But eventually, a new voice called to me. The cries of the elements drew me from my position as warchief…
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission6_03	I passed the mantle of leadership to Grommash's son, Garrosh Hellscream. And I left to discover what had caused the elements' suffering.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission6_04	It was Deathwing. Years after his defeat, the great corrupted Aspect made his return.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission6Intro_02	Your madness must come to an end, Earth-Warder!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission6ExchangeD_01	Aspects, I call upon your aid!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission6Victory_02	BEGONE!
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission7_01	After Deathwing's defeat, I continued my work as a shaman alongside the members of the Earthen Ring. With my beloved Aggra by my side, the days went quickly.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission7_02	I did not see the storm brewing back on Kalimdor, where Garrosh unleashed his cruelty and might upon Theramore.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission7_03	As horrible as he had been, Jaina's desire for vengeance disturbed me even more…
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission7Victory_05	I pray you will recover from this one day, Jaina…
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission8_01	Though overwhelmed by anger, Jaina had cut to the heart of the matter. Garrosh had gone down a dark path.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission8_02	I next heard of his trespasses from my own former counselor, Vol'jin. I went to him. I saw Garrosh's malice with my own eyes.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_PreMission8_03	And though I resisted it with every part of my being, I knew I had to face him.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission8Victory_01	You disappoint me, Garrosh. You are not worthy of your father's legacy. 
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission8Victory_02	Leadership is a heavy burden—too heavy for some to bear. I had no desire to take it up again. I needed something more...
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission8Victory_03	When I was young, I believed I had no family, and when I learned who they were, they had already passed.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission8Victory_04	But, even if your family is gone, it is never too late to make your own.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Blackmoore_Male_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission1Intro_01	Come witness the might of my pet orc!
VO_Story_Hero_Blackmoore_Male_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission1Intro_02	These people are paying good money, Thrall. I trust you'll put on a show for them?
VO_Story_Hero_Blackmoore_Male_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission1ExchangeA_01	I trained this orc foundling to become the ultimate warrior!
VO_Story_Hero_Blackmoore_Male_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission1ExchangeB_01	Would you believe me if I told you he also likes to read?
VO_Story_Hero_Blackmoore_Male_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission1Victory_01	Well, I'm off to celebrate and spend your earnings! Rest up for your next match, Thrall.
VO_Story_Hero_Blackmoore_Male_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission1EmoteResponse_01	No one pays to hear you talk, Thrall.
VO_Story_Hero_Blackmoore_Male_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission1HeroPower_01	Bring another challenger!
VO_Story_Hero_Blackmoore_Male_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission1HeroPower_02	Let's see how he fares against this one!
VO_Story_Hero_Blackmoore_Male_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission1HeroPower_03	Watch him defeat this foe!
VO_Story_Hero_Blackmoore_Male_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission1Loss_01	You owe me everything! And this is how you choose to repay me…
VO_Story_Hero_Blackmoore_Male_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission1Idle_01	Some people keep pet dogs or cats, but I prefer orcs. They eat a lot though.
VO_Story_Hero_Blackmoore_Male_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission1Idle_02	After the Second War, most orcs ended up in camps. However, they make great entertainment!
VO_Story_Hero_Blackmoore_Male_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission1Idle_03	This orc has been trained to be perfectly obedient. I'm certain he's not faking it. At all.

VO_Story_Minion_Taretha_Female_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission1ExchangeC_01	Thrall, this is too much for you.
VO_Story_Minion_Taretha_Female_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission1ExchangeC_03	He is wrong to treat you this way.
VO_Story_Minion_Taretha_Female_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission1Victory_03	He's gone! This is your chance to escape!
VO_Story_Minion_Taretha_Female_Human_TriggerThrallLowHP_01	Let me help you!
	
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2Intro_01	Prepare to meet the spirits of the natural world.
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2ExchangeA_01	What would you ask of the Spirit of Earth?
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2ExchangeA_03	Knowing is part of the test.
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2ExchangeB_01	It is granted.
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2ExchangeB_02	What would you ask of the Spirit of Air?
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2ExchangeC_01	It is done.
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2ExchangeC_02	What would you ask of the Spirit of Fire?
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2ExchangeD_01	So be it.
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2ExchangeD_02	What would you ask of the Spirit of Water?
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2ExchangeE_01	Very well. One element remains…
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2ExchangeE_02	What would you ask of the greatest of all, the Spirit of the Wilds?
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2Victory_01	All of the Spirits will aid you.
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2Victory_03	That is what makes you worthy.
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2Death_01	<_death exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	Look to the spirits, not to me.
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2Loss_01	What a shame. I had thought you were doing so well.
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2Idle_01	It requires patience to become a true shaman.
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2Idle_02	The orc shaman are older than the warlocks. Our ways are the ways of the clans before the Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission2Idle_03	Sometimes the spirits will not answer your call, and you must be prepared for that.
VO_Story_Hero_DrekThar_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3Victory_03	He is no stranger, Thrall.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim2_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3Intro_01	Hellscream is a fool. We have all seen what the humans can do… the bloodshed...
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim2_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3ExchangeA_02	See if you can take me, whelp!
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim2_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3ExchangeB_01	The Frostwolves are right to hide from the humans, far from the danger.
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim2_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3Victory_01	Long has it been since anyone could challenge me. I have found my second in command!
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim2_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3Victory_04	My name, son of Durotan, is Warchief Orgrim Doomhammer!
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim2_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3EmoteResponse_01	There is a spark in you. Good.
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim2_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3HeroPower_01	Yes, face my hammer!
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim2_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3HeroPower_02	Can you stand up to me?
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim2_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3HeroPower_03	How much fight can you bring?
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim2_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3Loss_01	I wonder… was I wrong to come here to meet you?
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim2_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3Idle_01	You are only just learning your history.
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim2_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3Idle_02	Should the orcs revolt, it will mean another war…
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim2_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3Idle_03	Do not ask me about my own clan… Theirs was a hard fate.
VO_Story_Hero_Orgrim2_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission3ExchangeE_01	Why must we suffer so much for so little? For valor? Bah.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Story_Thrall_Mission4Intro_01	I knew you would come, and I see you brought the mighty Hellscream.
VO_Story_Hero_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Story_Thrall_Mission4ExchangeA_01	His blood is mine, as is your whole cursed race!
VO_Story_Hero_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Story_Thrall_Mission4ExchangeB_01	You made the pact willingly, Hellscream.
VO_Story_Hero_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Story_Thrall_Mission4ExchangeB_02	You chose to drink my blood… to bind yourself to me.
VO_Story_Hero_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Story_Thrall_Mission4ExchangeC_01	And you, "Warchief"… you were not even there.
VO_Story_Hero_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Story_Thrall_Mission4HeroPower_01	I am the rage in your heart.
VO_Story_Hero_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Story_Thrall_Mission4HeroPower_02	Feel the fury of your thoughts.
VO_Story_Hero_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Story_Thrall_Mission4HeroPower_03	Stupid, pitiful creatures…
VO_Story_Hero_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Story_Thrall_Mission4EmoteResponse_01	Ahahahaha...
VO_Story_Hero_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Story_Thrall_Mission4Loss_01	The Horde has always belonged to ME.
VO_Story_Hero_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Story_Thrall_Mission4Idle_01	So much hatred in your heart, Hellscream… we are the same.
VO_Story_Hero_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Story_Thrall_Mission4Idle_02	I know what burns within your soul.
VO_Story_Hero_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Story_Thrall_Mission4Idle_03	All of this is futile, as it always has been.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Deathwing_Male_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6Intro_01	I will tear your world apart…
VO_Story_Hero_Deathwing_Male_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6ExchangeA_01	You shall burn as Azeroth itself does…
VO_Story_Hero_Deathwing_Male_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6ExchangeB_01	I am inevitable… indomitable!
VO_Story_Hero_Deathwing_Male_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6ExchangeC_01	Your armor means nothing, your faith even less!
VO_Story_Hero_Deathwing_Male_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6EmoteResponse_01	Insignificant!
VO_Story_Hero_Deathwing_Male_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6HeroPower_01	There is no shelter from my fury!
VO_Story_Hero_Deathwing_Male_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6HeroPower_02	I am the DESTROYER!
VO_Story_Hero_Deathwing_Male_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6HeroPower_03	Shatter to pieces!
VO__Male_Dragon_Death_01	Aaah!
VO_Story_Hero_Deathwing_Male_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6Loss_01	I will destroy all other creatures who yet draw breath…
VO_Story_Hero_Deathwing_Male_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6Idle_01	Your kingdoms crumble beneath my rage!
VO_Story_Hero_Deathwing_Male_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6Idle_02	Pain… agony… you do not know them as I do!
VO_Story_Hero_Deathwing_Male_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6Idle_03	Surrender all hope, and tremble before your fate!
	
VO_Story_Minion_Ysera_Female_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6ExchangeD_01	Alas, to see a fellow Dragon Aspect fall to such corruption…
VO_Story_Minion_Ysera_Female_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6ExchangeD_02	The rest of us shall support you as we can.
VO_Story_Minion_Ysera_Female_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6ExchangeE_02	We shall channel our power into the Dragon Soul!
VO_Story_Minion_Ysera_Female_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6Victory_01	Strike true, Thrall! This moment can never be undone!

VO_Story_Minion_Alexstrasza_Female_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6ExchangeE_01	I will cleanse whatever corruption I can.
VO_Story_Minion_Alexstrasza_Female_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6ExchangeF_01	Deathwing's summoning of the final Cataclysm will destroy all life on Azeroth. Quickly, we must interrupt him.
VO_Story_Minion_Alexstrasza_Female_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6ExchangeG_01	He is completely mad.
VO_Story_Minion_Alexstrasza_Female_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6Victory_03	We dragon aspects have fulfilled our great purpose.
VO_Story_Minion_Alexstrasza_Female_Dragon_Story_Thrall_Mission6Victory_04	You are Azeroth's true guardians and the future of this world is in your hands.

VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission7EmoteResponse_01	I won't hear this!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission7HeroPower_01	Suffer as Theramore did!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission7HeroPower_02	Take responsibility!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission7HeroPower_03	Everything is gone. Everything!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission7Loss_01	We could have had peace, Thrall. But you threw it all away.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission7Idle_01	I never should have trusted you. How could I have been so naïve?
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission7Idle_02	You knew Garrosh was dangerous. His father could not control his rage either!
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Thrall_Mission7Idle_03	We both came to this land to start over. Now your people thrive, and mine mourn their dead.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission8HeroPower_01	You are no more than a traitor now!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission8HeroPower_02	I answer to NO ONE!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission8HeroPower_03	Behold my strength!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission8EmoteResponse_01	You have much to learn…
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission8Loss_01	Under my leadership, the Horde will conquer all…
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission8Idle_01	You once promised me a great destiny because of my father… Now you betray me.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission8Idle_02	I will never be the leader you were. I will be more!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Thrall_Mission8Idle_03	You admired my father for the same reasons you reprimand me—our rage, our strength!

VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Select_01	I am Rokara of the Frostwolf clan!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_PreMission1_01	I swore to serve my clan as a great warrior. That oath has brought me here, to Orgrimmar.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_PreMission1_02	A new peon? Is this the best the Frostwolves can send us? Bring me a shaman! We’ll see if you belong in my Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission1Intro_01	I am Rokara of the Frostwolf clan!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission1Intro_02	I am…ready for breakfast. 
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission1Victory_01	Hmph. Well fought. Bru’kan will see to your training. The Warchief has need of fresh warriors.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission1Victory_02	I will serve with honor! Where now? Silverpine Forest? Stonetalon Mountains? I’ve always wanted to – 
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission1Victory_03	You go to the Barrens! We’ll make a grunt of you yet.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission1Loss_01	You have much to learn, young one.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission1Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission1EmoteResponse_01	You fight better when you aren’t yapping.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission1HeroPower_01	Ha!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission1HeroPower_02	Totally totems!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission1HeroPower_03	Try this!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission1Hit_01	This one’s got a real fire in her, Garrosh.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission1Hit_02	Such fury…and such control! Impressive.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission1Hit_03	Heh hah! Her spirit is strong, like that of her clan!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission1Idle_01	I haven’t got all day. I’m starving!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission1Idle_02	<_Snores_>
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission1Idle_03	A storm’s coming. I feel it in these old bones.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission1ExchangeA_01	Don’t go easy on him. There is more to Bru’kan than he lets on.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission1ExchangeA_02	<_Belch_>
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission1ExchangeB_01	My clan has honor! Warchief Thrall is a Frostwolf.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission1ExchangeB_02	I tamed the elements before Thrall tamed his nappy!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission1ExchangeC_01	Garrosh Hellscream…son of Grommash! The tales of your father are legendary. 
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission1ExchangeC_02	Focus on the fight! Serve me and I will build the glorious Horde my father could only dream of.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission1ExchangeD_01	You’re pretty good. Strong enough to carry my backpack.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission1ExchangeD_02	I’ll prove how strong I am. For the Horde!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission1ExchangeD_03	For an early lunch!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission1ExchangeE_01	You’re tougher than you look, old troll.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission1ExchangeE_02	I have trained many young orc-lings, but none so driven as you.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_PreMission2_01	The Barrens lived up to its name, but at least I had my teacher for company.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_PreMission2_02	It seemed like we walked for ages. (Bru’kan said I wasn’t ready for a mount.)
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_PreMission2_03	I will teach you five lessons to become a true member of the Horde. “You must prove yourself worthy!” That is the first lesson. 
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission2Intro_01	Bru’kan, look! That tauren is in trouble. We have to help him!
VO_Story_Hero_HezrulBloodmark_Male_Centaur_Story_Rokara_Mission2Intro_02	You trespass on Kolkar lands.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission2Victory_01	Thank you for saving me. I am Guff Runetotem.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission2Victory_02	We could use a healer, and I’d never forgive myself if something happened to you. Come with us!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission2Victory_03	Woohoo! Guff’s going on an adventure!
VO_Story_Hero_HezrulBloodmark_Male_Centaur_Story_Rokara_Mission2Loss_01	Now we ride to burn the Crossroads!
VO_Story_Hero_HezrulBloodmark_Male_Centaur_Story_Rokara_Mission2Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_HezrulBloodmark_Male_Centaur_Story_Rokara_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	I am a chief. I answer to no orc.
VO_Story_Hero_HezrulBloodmark_Male_Centaur_Story_Rokara_Mission2HeroPower_01	<_Snort_>
VO_Story_Hero_HezrulBloodmark_Male_Centaur_Story_Rokara_Mission2HeroPower_02	Go, hyenas!
VO_Story_Hero_HezrulBloodmark_Male_Centaur_Story_Rokara_Mission2HeroPower_03	<_Indignant neighing_>
VO_Story_Hero_HezrulBloodmark_Male_Centaur_Story_Rokara_Mission2Idle_01	<_Impatient neighing_>
VO_Story_Hero_HezrulBloodmark_Male_Centaur_Story_Rokara_Mission2Idle_02	We have tolerated your incursions long enough.
VO_Story_Hero_HezrulBloodmark_Male_Centaur_Story_Rokara_Mission2Idle_03	Aren’t you a little short for a grunt?
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission2HeroPower_01	Nature calls!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission2HeroPower_02	Shocking!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission2HeroPower_03	After this I’ll have some tea!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission2HeroPower_04	You be careful.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission2HeroPower_05	Spirits guide me.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission2HeroPower_06	<_Grunt_>
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission2ExchangeA_01	I was only smelling the wildflowers, Mister Centaur. See? Aren’t they pretty?
VO_Story_Hero_HezrulBloodmark_Male_Centaur_Story_Rokara_Mission2ExchangeA_02	<_Aggressive neighing_>
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission2ExchangeA_03	You stepped on the pretty flowers!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission2ExchangeB_01	Hey! Your fight is with me, centaur. Let the tauren go.
VO_Story_Hero_HezrulBloodmark_Male_Centaur_Story_Rokara_Mission2ExchangeB_02	I shall grind your bones beneath my hooves and use his horns as a back scratcher!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission2ExchangeB_03	So much for negotiating.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission2ExchangeC_01	Tauren! Help us fight this enemy. 
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission2ExchangeC_02	Fight? Me? I don’t know. But wait! I can help you.
VO_Story_Hero_HezrulBloodmark_Male_Centaur_Story_Rokara_Mission2ExchangeD_01	I will trample you all!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission2ExchangeD_02	Rokara…it is time for your second lesson. And that lesson is… “For the Horde!”
	
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_PreMission3_01	Bru’kan led us south, deep into the heart of the Barrens, on guard for quilboar ambushes. The young tauren druid proved to be…a handful.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_PreMission3_02	Look! It’s a cute little scorpid. Hey little guy. Ouch! Careful! You poked me with your stinger there.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_PreMission3_03	Aww, the scorpid was just saying hi, weren’t you…oh…feeling a little woozy.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission3Intro_01	Look at that quilboar! It’s horrifying.
VO_Story_Hero_Plaguemaw_Male_Quilboar_Story_Rokara_Mission3Intro_02	<_Roar! Squeal!_>
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission3Victory_01	I suppose you commoners expect me to thank you.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission3Victory_02	You can! By joining us on our quest. We could use a warlock’s talents in the Barrens.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission3Victory_03	Remember, Rokara. Horde is family, no matter what you look like. That…is the third lesson.
VO_Story_Hero_Plaguemaw_Male_Quilboar_Story_Rokara_Mission3Loss_01	<_Snort, Squeal, Evil Chuckle_>
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission3HeroPower_01	Blessings of the Earthmother…in cookie form!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission3HeroPower_02	Whoops! I’m a bull in an alchemist’s shop.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission3HeroPower_03	Nature will rise against litterbugs!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission3HeroPower_04	Peace, friend.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission3HeroPower_06	<_Soothing Sounds_>
VO_Story_Hero_Plaguemaw_Male_Quilboar_Story_Rokara_Mission3Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Plaguemaw_Male_Quilboar_Story_Rokara_Mission3EmoteResponse_01	<_Hostile squeal_>

VO_Story_Hero_Plaguemaw_Male_Quilboar_Story_Rokara_Mission3Idle_03	<_Bristle_>
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission3ExchangeA_01	Obey me, you lousy necrotized lug!
VO_Story_Hero_Plaguemaw_Male_Quilboar_Story_Rokara_Mission3ExchangeA_02	<_Roar_>
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission3ExchangeB_Brukan_01	If that warlock can’t tame the beast, it will surely kill her…again.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission3ExchangeB_Guff_01	Looks like that warlock is having trouble. She should try asking the quilboar nicely.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission3ExchangeB_03	They are both abominations. We should slay them both!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission3ExchangeC_Brukan_01	No, Rokara. Forsaken like her are a part of the Horde. We must help her.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission3ExchangeC_Guff_01	Nooo, Rokara! I’m sure they’re both very nice, if a bit smelly. Don’t tell them I said that.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission3ExchangeC_03	If you say so.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission3ExchangeD_01	Yes, help me! It’s not like I raised this giant quilboar from the dead.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission3ExchangeD_02	And I certainly didn’t do it to lay waste to my enemies.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_PreMission4_01	The warlock’s name was Tamsin Roame, formerly one of the finest students at Scholomance.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_PreMission4_02	THE finest student at Scholomance. Get it right!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_PreMission4_03	The next step on our journey was – Guff, what are you doing? Get away from the water!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission4Intro_01	Guff, where are you taking us – Oh no!

VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission4Victory_01	You have learned the fourth lesson, Rokara. No challenge is too great for the Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission4Victory_02	Now come. Our true quest is about to begin. We have a troll to meet in Ratchet.
UNG_010_SatedThreshadon_Attack	<_ROOOOOAAAAARARRRSSS!_>
UNG_010_SatedThreshadon_Play	<_Aquatic roar_>
UNG_010_SatedThreshadon_Death	<_Death_>

VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission4HeroPower_01	Maim, my pretties! Maim!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission4HeroPower_02	I love their beady little eyes. So cute!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission4HeroPower_03	Quiver in fear!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission4HeroPower_04	Run amok!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission4ExchangeA_01	A giant threshadon!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission4ExchangeA_Brukan_01	Not just any threshadon. That is Isha Awak, terror of the Merchant Coast, feared by the Horde, Alliance, even pirates!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission4ExchangeA_Brukan_02	Pirates are cool.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission4ExchangeA_Guff_01	That is Isha Awak! Terror of the sea! It eats orcs. And it’s cute.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission4ExchangeA_Guff_02	Well, tell him my armor tastes terrible.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission4ExchangeA_Tamsin_01	Pah! The threshadons in Darrowmere Lake are much bigger.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission4ExchangeA_Tamsin_02	You say that like it’s a good thing!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission4ExchangeB_Brukan_01	Focus, Rokara! This is your most dangerous battle yet. Slay the beast!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission4ExchangeB_Guff_01	A little salt, some spices, and I’m sure we can make your armor taste great!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission4ExchangeB_Tamsin_01	It is a good thing because I hunted those beasts for sport. This one should be easy.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Rokara_Mission4ExchangeC_01	Note to self: Frostbolt causes indigestion in gargantuan aquatic fauna.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission4ExchangeC_Guff_01	That elf must ALSO taste terrible.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission4ExchangeC_Brukan_01	A child of the blood – sin’dorei!  
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission4ExchangeC_Tamsin_01	A mage from Silvermoon. Fascinating.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Rokara_Mission4ExchangeD_01	You can call me Dawngrasp. Thank you for coming to my aid.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Rokara_Mission4ExchangeD_02	If we survive this, we should fight together. For the Horde!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission4ExchangeD_03	Yeah! For the Horde!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_PreMission5_01	Ah, welcome! You must be young Rokara. Sit, sit! It is good to know the Horde still sends its bravest to help old Kazakus with his missing caravan.
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_PreMission5_02	I need you to find what remains of the cargo. Try to retrieve the caravan’s security system if you can. It shouldn’t be any trouble for heroes like you.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission5Intro_01	There’s the caravan! But what’s that big statue?
VO_Story_Hero_Golem_Male_Mech_Story_Rokara_Mission5Intro_02	Detected – Unidentified humanoids. Engage defense protocol.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission5Victory_01	We did it! Now what are these glowing stones?
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Rokara_Mission5Victory_02	Those “stones” are shards of fractured Light, consistent with the composition of the energy sentients known as the naaru.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission5Victory_03	Thanks, I hate it.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission5Victory_04	Come on. Let’s pack these up and get them back to Kazakus.
VO_Story_Hero_Golem_Male_Mech_Story_Rokara_Mission5Loss_01	The package is secure.
VO_Story_Hero_Golem_Male_Mech_Story_Rokara_Mission5Death_01	<_Death explosion!_>
VO_Story_Hero_Golem_Male_Mech_Story_Rokara_Mission5EmoteResponse_01	Halt. Prepare to be neutralized.
VO_Story_Hero_Golem_Male_Mech_Story_Rokara_Mission5HeroPower_01	Modify loadout.
VO_Story_Hero_Golem_Male_Mech_Story_Rokara_Mission5HeroPower_02	Reticulate splines.
VO_Story_Hero_Golem_Male_Mech_Story_Rokara_Mission5HeroPower_03	Enhance.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Rokara_Mission5HeroPower_01	Precisely!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Rokara_Mission5HeroPower_02	Take this!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Rokara_Mission5HeroPower_03	Bash’a no falor talah!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Rokara_Mission5HeroPower_04	Fear my frost!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Rokara_Mission5HeroPower_05	You have much to learn.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Rokara_Mission5HeroPower_06	<_Grunt_>
VO_Story_Hero_Golem_Male_Mech_Story_Rokara_Mission5Idle_01	Discordance. Recklessness. Imperfection.
VO_Story_Hero_Golem_Male_Mech_Story_Rokara_Mission5Idle_02	Scanning…
VO_Story_Hero_Golem_Male_Mech_Story_Rokara_Mission5Idle_03	<_???_>
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeA_01	Looks like we found the troll’s security system, but it’s not looking very secure. We have to stop it.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeA_Tamsin_01	Whatever’s in that caravan must be valuable and will aid me in my quest for power!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeA_Brukan_01	Remember what you’ve learned. I’ll be by your side.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeA_Dawngrasp_01	Let’s teach this thing the freeze dance.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeA_Guff_01	Um, excuse me, Big Statue Person? Can you go back to statue-ing, please?
VO_Story_Hero_Golem_Male_Mech_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeB_01	Target acquired.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeC_Brukan_01	Rokara, if things get out of hand, I want you to run away.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeC_Brukan_02	What?!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeC_Dawngrasp_01	Rokara, if I perish, tell the Silvermoon magisters I fought bravely. They will have their doubts.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeC_Guff_01	Is anyone hurt? I can heal you!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeC_Guff_02	Guff, you’re always so helpful.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeC_Tamsin_01	You think I’m afraid of a rust bucket like you? I faced the Lich King in single combat, and lived!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeC_Tamsin_02	Well, technically, I didn't live, but I got better! You won’t!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeD_Brukan_02	Don’t talk like that! I’m going to get us out of this. Just watch.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeD_Tamsin_01	What brought you to the Barrens, Tamsin?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeD_Tamsin_02	A patron encouraged me to seek my fortune here. She sees a bright future in me.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeD_Guff_01	You really think I’m helpful? Back home everyone's always saying, “You’re in the way, Guff!” and “Don’t drink that, Guff. It’s for ceremonies.”
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeD_Brukan_01	I have lived my time, and perhaps, in training you, I have finally made amends.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeD_Dawngrasp_01	I trained under Prince Kael’thas himself, you know. Please – don’t judge. I get enough of that back home.
VO_Story_Hero_Golem_Male_Mech_Story_Rokara_Mission5ExchangeE_01	Disperse countermeasures.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_PreMission6_01	You’ve done well, but one of the shards from my caravan has gone missing.
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_PreMission6_02	My associates have traced the shard to a miner named Feegly out of a dwarf fortress near Bael Modan. Find the shard and bring it to me. 
VO_Story_Hero_Twinbraid_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission6Intro_01	Horde intruders! Get them!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission6Intro_02	Ambush!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission6Victory_01	Now answer me, dwarf. Where is the one you call Feegly?
VO_Story_Hero_Twinbraid_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission6Victory_02	FEEGLY? He’s gone mad! Found some big gemstone and fled into the mines.
VO_Story_Hero_Twinbraid_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission6Victory_03	Go ahead and follow him. I hope you suffer the same fate!
VO_Story_Hero_Twinbraid_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission6Loss_01	Aww…is that it?
VO_Story_Hero_Twinbraid_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission6Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Twinbraid_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission6EmoteResponse_01	My troops have you surrounded.
VO_Story_Hero_Twinbraid_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission6HeroPower_01	Power up!
VO_Story_Hero_Twinbraid_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission6HeroPower_02	Say hello to my little friend!
VO_Story_Hero_Twinbraid_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission6HeroPower_03	<_Metallic armor clanking sounds_>
VO_Story_Hero_Twinbraid_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission6Idle_01	Echeyakee got your tongue?
VO_Story_Hero_Twinbraid_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission6Idle_02	Are you thinking about the most graceful way to lose?
VO_Story_Hero_Twinbraid_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission6Idle_03	You Horde types aren’t so tough.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission6ExchangeA_01	Why can’t anything in the Barrens ever be easy?
VO_Story_Hero_Twinbraid_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission6ExchangeA_02	Less whining more fighting!
VO_Story_Hero_Twinbraid_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission6ExchangeB_01	Ironforge will prevail!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission6ExchangeB_02	Without all your fancy armor and weapons you’re just facial hair and bluster.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission6ExchangeC_Brukan_01	We have no quarrel with you dwarves.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission6ExchangeC_Tamsin_01	Foolish dwarves. They love their forges but neglect to harness true power.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Rokara_Mission6ExchangeC_Dawngrasp_01	Theoretically, there is nothing to prevent us all from coexisting. And yet…
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission6ExchangeC_Guff_01	I don’t like this, Rokara. Their sticks make LOUD NOISES.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission6ExchangeD_01	Bru’kan, after that last battle, I thought for sure you would teach me your fifth and final lesson.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission6ExchangeD_02	Bah! You are not ready for the final lesson! Not even close!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_PreMission7_01	We searched the dig site at Bael Modan. The thief Feegly was at the bottom of a mine. He cradled the shard like a wolf pup. The magic in it had done something frightening to him.
VO_Story_Hero_Feegly_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_PreMission7_02	Please…I don’t want to fight. Heh heh heh.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission7Intro_01	Feegly, drop the shard.
VO_Story_Hero_Feegly_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission7Intro_02	The shard has changed me. It will change you too.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission7Victory_01	I couldn’t do it. There was no honor in that kill.
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission7Victory_02	Return to Orgrimmar. Your work here is done.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission7Victory_Brukan_01	You showed strength and discipline.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Rokara_Mission7Victory_Dawngrasp_01	The outcome was inescapable as soon as Kazakus intervened. There is nothing you could have done.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission7Victory_Guff_01	No kill has honor, Rokara, but you do.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission7Victory_Tamsin_01	Nobody is perfect, Rokara. But don’t worry, you can mercilessly crush your enemies next time.
VO_Story_Hero_Feegly_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission7Loss_01	Quake before the shard’s power!
VO_Story_Hero_Feegly_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission7Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Feegly_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission7EmoteResponse_01	<_Evil, crazy laugh_>
VO_Story_Hero_Feegly_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission7HeroPower_01	Behold its power!
VO_Story_Hero_Feegly_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission7HeroPower_02	I will change you.
VO_Story_Hero_Feegly_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission7HeroPower_03	Transform!
VO_Story_Hero_Feegly_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission7Idle_01	<_Snickers_>
VO_Story_Hero_Feegly_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission7Idle_02	Don’t touch my shard.
VO_Story_Hero_Feegly_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission7Idle_03	My shard, mine! Heheheh.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission7ExchangeA_01	We won’t hurt you, just give it to us.
VO_Story_Hero_Feegly_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission7ExchangeA_02	The shard…it speaks to me.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission7ExchangeB_01	I don’t care if the shard sings you a gnomish jig. Hand it over.
VO_Story_Hero_Feegly_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission7ExchangeB_02	Eeeheehee. They all have power. But together…so much more. Like you…and your friends.
VO_Story_Hero_Feegly_Male_Dwarf_Story_Rokara_Mission7ExchangeC_01	I must assemble the shards. I could bring back the dead…or bring Azeroth to its knees!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission7ExchangeC_Brukan_01	Elements protect us!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Rokara_Mission7ExchangeC_Dawngrasp_01	The raw, unfiltered power of a naaru reformed!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Rokara_Mission7ExchangeC_Guff_01	But I like Azeroth!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Rokara_Mission7ExchangeC_Tamsin_01	And, uh…where did you say these shards were again?
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission7ExchangeD_01	What is taking so long? Get me that shard!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission7ExchangeD_02	Kazakus, what are you doing here?
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission7ExchangeD_03	I grew impatient of waiting. I will help you now.
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission7ExchangeE_01	I have brewed an elixir to help you in your fight.
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission7ExchangeF_01	I have assembled a golem for you. Try not to break it.
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission7ExchangeG_01	He is beaten. Destroy him and claim the shard.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission7ExchangeG_02	But he’s helpless. I can’t.
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission7ExchangeG_03	Coward! I’ll finish this myself.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_PreMission8_01	Our party dwindled on the walk back to Orgrimmar. Guff returned to Thunder Bluff.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_PreMission8_02	Dawngrasp said they wanted to explore the region’s oases, and Tamsin said she wanted to search Dreadmist Peak, both for more shards.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_PreMission8_03	When Bru’kan and I reached Orgrimmar, Garrosh was waiting.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_PreMission8_04	I have heard of your successes, whelp, and your failures. Let’s see if you’ve learned enough to stay alive in battle with ME!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8Intro_01	I’m surprised the Barrens did not break you.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8Intro_02	I broke the Barrens!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8Victory_01	I did it, Bru’kan! I passed Garrosh’s test!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8Victory_02	But Garrosh is wrong about the Horde. Compassion is strength. Mercy is honor.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8Victory_03	I should never have idolized him. I must follow my own principles and believe in myself.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Rokara_Mission8Victory_04	Rokara…that is the final lesson.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8Loss_01	You are beaten.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8EmoteResponse_01	Only victors have honor!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8HeroPower_01	I will never break!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8HeroPower_02	Your heart makes you weak!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8HeroPower_03	I am invincible!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8Idle_01	You don’t stand a chance against me!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8Idle_02	Your weakness makes you hesitate.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8Idle_03	Young orcs don’t know the meaning of strength.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8ExchangeA_01	See if you can break my armor. I won’t go easy on you.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8ExchangeA_02	Nor I you!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8ExchangeB_01	Why did you spare the life of that FREAK who had stolen the shard?
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8ExchangeB_02	I pitied him. As Horde I showed him mercy.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8ExchangeB_03	Heh. I pity those that show mercy.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8ExchangeC_01	Blood and thunder!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8ExchangeC_02	Strength and honor!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8ExchangeD_01	Hmph – you fight well. But this “mercy” will make you weak. I will cut ALL the weakness from the Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8ExchangeD_02	Then maybe it’s a good thing you’re not Warchief.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8ExchangeE_01	What is honor without mercy? You would have me destroy the helpless?
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8ExchangeE_02	I would have you do as you’re told!
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8ExchangeF_01	Enough! You have proven your prowess in combat, though you should learn to guard your tongue.
VO_Story_Hero_Garrosh_Male_Orc_Story_Rokara_Mission8ExchangeF_02	You are now a champion in service of the Warchief. Prepare for your next assignment.

VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_PreMission1_01	I am a priestess of the Light of Creation. My only daughter, Runi, lies in a coma. I have tried everything in my power to save her. I failed.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_PreMission1_02	One night there was an explosion in the sky. Shards of light rained across Azeroth. We called it “The Night of Falling Stars.”
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_PreMission1_03	I had a vision. A voice spoke: Find the shards; save your child. I saw a barren land in Kalimdor, filled with dangers. I saw an iron tower on a black lake. I kissed my child goodbye and set out to save her life.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission1Intro_01	Watch post grunts! I need to slip by and enter the Barrens.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission1ExchangeB_01	Light’s blessing to you, sir hunter. I am Xyrella. Are you injured?
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission1ExchangeB_03	Hold still. I will heal your wounds.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission1ExchangeC_02	My people have been cast out of lands before.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission1ExchangeD_01	I need a guide to help me through the Barrens. If we survive this, will you help me?
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission1Victory_02	We did it! Wait, sir hunter, where are you going? Come back!
VO_Story_Hero_Kargal_Male_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission1Intro_02	This is your last chance, dwarf. Put down the boomstick now and we’ll only shave your beard. Heh, heh.
VO_Story_Hero_Kargal_Male_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission1ExchangeA_02	If you insist!
VO_Story_Hero_Kargal_Male_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission1ExchangeC_01	The Barrens belong to the Horde. You Alliance should stay away!
VO_Story_Hero_Kargal_Male_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission1Victory_01	Fall back, grunts! That dwarf and his healer are too powerful!
VO_Story_Hero_Kargal_Male_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission1Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Kargal_Male_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission1EmoteResponse_01	Begone!
VO_Story_Hero_Kargal_Male_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission1HeroPower_01	To arms!
VO_Story_Hero_Kargal_Male_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission1HeroPower_02	Battle stations!

VO_Story_Hero_Kargal_Male_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission1Loss_01	Taste my steel!
VO_Story_Hero_Kargal_Male_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission1Idle_01	What you looking at?
VO_Story_Hero_Kargal_Male_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission1Idle_02	We’ve got enough problems.
VO_Story_Hero_Kargal_Male_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission1Idle_03	Come on, fight!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission1ExchangeA_01	You’ll never take me alive!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission1ExchangeB_02	What’s it look like, ya busybody? I’m wearin’ this orc arrow in my shoulder as a fashion statement?
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission1ExchangeD_02	I’m already on a contract.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_PreMission2_01	We broke through the orcs’ watch post, but I knew the Barrens would claim me without aid.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_PreMission2_02	Though he refused to admit it, the same seemed true for the dwarf as well.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission2Intro_01	Stay, you fiend.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission2ExchangeA_01	This dwarf is under my protection.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission2ExchangeB_02	There are so many of them. Are you sure?
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission2ExchangeC_02	She said you stole from her.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission2ExchangeD_01	Do you know these lands? I am searching for an iron tower at the center of a black lake.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission2ExchangeE_01	If gold is all you care about, you can have my share of the loot. I only want to save my daughter.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission2Victory_02	I cannot promise riches or glory, but I swear on my life I’ll try to keep you standing in one piece.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission2ExchangeB_01	I told ya, lass. I don’t need any of your help.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission2ExchangeC_01	Don’t believe a word she says.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission2ExchangeC_03	Oh, well, of course I did that.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission2ExchangeD_02	You’re speakin’ in riddles, but I’ll take ya where you’re goin’…for a price.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission2ExchangeE_02	All right. You’re gonna make my beard all tear soaked.  
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission2Victory_01	You’re not bad in a fight, lassie. I’m Tavish Stormpike, at no one’s service but my own.
VO_Story_Hero_Serena_Female_Harpy_Story_Xyrella_Mission2Intro_02	Caw!
VO_Story_Hero_Serena_Female_Harpy_Story_Xyrella_Mission2ExchangeA_02	He stole from our treasure trove. He must die. Die!
VO_Story_Hero_Serena_Female_Harpy_Story_Xyrella_Mission2Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Serena_Female_Harpy_Story_Xyrella_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	You are caught in my trap!
VO_Story_Hero_Serena_Female_Harpy_Story_Xyrella_Mission2HeroPower_01	Witchwing!
VO_Story_Hero_Serena_Female_Harpy_Story_Xyrella_Mission2HeroPower_02	Die in shadow!
VO_Story_Hero_Serena_Female_Harpy_Story_Xyrella_Mission2HeroPower_03	Caw!
VO_Story_Hero_Serena_Female_Harpy_Story_Xyrella_Mission2HeroPower_04	We will feed you both to our young!
VO_Story_Hero_Serena_Female_Harpy_Story_Xyrella_Mission2HeroPower_05	Suffer for your crimes!
VO_Story_Hero_Serena_Female_Harpy_Story_Xyrella_Mission2Loss_01	It’s feeding time!
VO_Story_Hero_Serena_Female_Harpy_Story_Xyrella_Mission2Idle_01	My sister was killed by the Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Serena_Female_Harpy_Story_Xyrella_Mission2Idle_02	We may share a common enemy, but that doesn’t make us friends.
VO_Story_Hero_Serena_Female_Harpy_Story_Xyrella_Mission2Idle_03	Return what you stole!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission3Intro_01	That’s it! A black lake…filled with sludge.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission3ExchangeA_02	Good thing I have such a skilled hunter to protect me.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission3ExchangeB_01	In my vision, I saw a shard of light at the top of the tower. We must reach the summit!
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission3ExchangeC_02	Easy, huh? Maybe for you.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission3ExchangeD_01	Do you have any family, Tavish?
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission3ExchangeE_01	Ugh, the fumes. It seems nature is in turmoil here.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_PreMission3_01	To the east is an oil field at Sludge Fen. The Venture Trading Company operates a rig there.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_PreMission3_02	I’d bet my beard the iron tower from your vision is that rig. Follow me.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission3ExchangeA_01	I wouldn’t expect a warm welcome from the local wildlife.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission3ExchangeB_02	Looks like we’ll have to fight our way up.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission3ExchangeC_01	This’ll be easy. Get to the top of the oil rig, find the shard, and your daughter’ll be as good as new in no time.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission3ExchangeD_02	Aye, the Stormpike clan. A noble house if yer from the side of the family with money.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission3ExchangeF_01	Oy! I got crud all over my boots! Let’s hurry up and finish this thing!
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission3Victory_01	Security’s tight. We’ll need to create a diversion. But don’t worry, I got an idea.

VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_PreMission4_02	That terrible-looking machine with the sawblades? We should stay away.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission4Intro_01	Are we truly going to fight this thing?
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission4ExchangeA_02	Tavish! Are you worried about me?
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission4ExchangeB_02	And what exactly are we going to do with it?
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_PreMission4_01	We need more firepower to cut through those goblins’ defenses. See that shredder over there?
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_PreMission4_03	Aye! I mean, no! We’re stealin’ it!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission4ExchangeA_01	Careful, Xyrella. Goblin technology’s not exactly the most reliable.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission4ExchangeB_01	I’m not worried about you. I’m worried our beautiful new shredder’s gonna be damaged.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission4ExchangeC_01	Ah, just keep those healin’ spells comin’. I’ll handle this.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission4Victory_01	Hoohoo! And the shredder’s still in one piece. All aboard!
VO_Story_Hero_Whirleygig_Male_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission4Intro_02	I still gotta meet today’s quota. Get outta here!
VO_Story_Hero_Whirleygig_Male_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission4Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Whirleygig_Male_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission4EmoteResponse_01	I ain’t even reached the deductible on this mech.
VO_Story_Hero_Whirleygig_Male_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission4HeroPower_01	Black gold, baby!
VO_Story_Hero_Whirleygig_Male_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission4HeroPower_02	Chippity choppity!
VO_Story_Hero_Whirleygig_Male_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission4HeroPower_03	<_Buzzsaw sounds_>
VO_Story_Hero_Whirleygig_Male_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission4Loss_01	Welp, back to work!
VO_Story_Hero_Whirleygig_Male_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission4Idle_01	I chop down trees and wear suspenders!
VO_Story_Hero_Whirleygig_Male_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission4Idle_02	Maybe someday I’ll upgrade to a SUPER shredder.
VO_Story_Hero_Whirleygig_Male_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission4Idle_03	Time is money, foe! Waddaya think this is, a game?
	
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_PreMission5_01	I fear you are too reckless, Tavish. I will pilot this “Shredder.”
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission5Intro_01	Clear out of the way! We just want the shard.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission5ExchangeA_02	Please. I must have it. Lives hang in the balance.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission5ExchangeB_01	I can freeze them. Focus on their leader.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission5ExchangeB_02	Fire the net!
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission5ExchangeB_03	Rev the motor!
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission5ExchangeD_02	Brace yourself, Tavish!
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission5Victory_02	We’re close. I feel the Light call to me.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_PreMission5_02	You wot? Can you even work the pedals with hooves? Ahh! Wait up!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission5ExchangeC_01	There are so many of them! Let me handle this.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission5Victory_01	This shredder has been shot to bits, but we made it.
VO_Story_Hero_Trixie_Female_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission5Intro_02	They’re after the shard! Kill ‘em!
VO_Story_Hero_Trixie_Female_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission5ExchangeA_01	You can’t have the shard. It’s worth a mint!
VO_Story_Hero_Trixie_Female_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission5ExchangeB_04	Hey, no fair!
VO_Story_Hero_Trixie_Female_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission5ExchangeC_02	I’ll handle YOU!
VO_Story_Hero_Trixie_Female_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission5ExchangeD_01	I need reinforcements!
VO_Story_Hero_Trixie_Female_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission5Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Trixie_Female_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission5EmoteResponse_01	Secure the Samophlange!
VO_Story_Hero_Trixie_Female_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission5HeroPower_01	Bullseye!
VO_Story_Hero_Trixie_Female_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission5HeroPower_02	Watch yer noggin!
VO_Story_Hero_Trixie_Female_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission5HeroPower_03	Heads up!
VO_Story_Hero_Trixie_Female_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission5Loss_01	Looks like scrap metal’s back on the menu, boys!
VO_Story_Hero_Trixie_Female_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission5Idle_01	So a draenei, a dwarf, and a shredder walk into an ambush.
VO_Story_Hero_Trixie_Female_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission5Idle_02	I better be making overtime for this.
VO_Story_Hero_Trixie_Female_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission5Idle_03	At this rate, your shredder’s gonna run outta fuel.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_PreMission6_01	This is the control room. The shard must be nearby.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission6Intro_01	There IS a gnome! And he looks…terrifying?
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission6ExchangeA_02	We can work together.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission6ExchangeC_01	Watch out! The whole control room is trapped.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission6ExchangeF_01	If you’re both in the Alliance then we should all work together.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission6Victory_02	Then let us see it through together, the rest of the way.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_PreMission6_02	But first we’ve gotta get past the security, the traps, that gnome – gnome? What’s a gnome doin’ here?
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission6ExchangeB_02	So did I! Before I met her.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission6ExchangeD_01	Not bad! Those are some SI:7 moves.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission6ExchangeE_01	I know they’re Stormwind’s gaggle of spies…who fight just like you do.
VO_Story_Hero_Sniggles_Male_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission6Intro_02	You Alliance types will never get past my defenses!
VO_Story_Hero_Sniggles_Male_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission6Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Sniggles_Male_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission6EmoteResponse_01	I’ve installed the most affordable anti-theft technology.

VO_Story_Hero_Sniggles_Male_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission6HeroPower_03	<_Ropes tightening_>
VO_Story_Hero_Sniggles_Male_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission6Loss_01	Maybe now I’ll get a promotion!
VO_Story_Hero_Sniggles_Male_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission6Idle_01	Are you three really working together?
VO_Story_Hero_Sniggles_Male_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission6Idle_02	You gotta make a move sometime!
VO_Story_Hero_Sniggles_Male_Goblin_Story_Xyrella_Mission6Idle_03	Get! Off! My! Rig!
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Mission6ExchangeA_01	Hey, get outta here! I infiltrated this oil rig first – and much more quietly!
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Mission6ExchangeB_01	Sorry, lady, I work alone.
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Mission6ExchangeD_02	What do you know about SI:7?
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Mission6ExchangeE_02	Will you keep your big flapping mouth shut?
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Mission6ExchangeF_02	Hm. I suppose that IS the definition of “Alliance.” Let’s do this.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Mission6Victory_01	We make a pretty good team.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission7Intro_01	The shard is powering that strange machine.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission7ExchangeA_01	By the Light of Creation – here, at the top of the iron tower – my vision comes to pass!
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission7ExchangeB_01	Try to surround it! Watch out for its tentacles!
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission7ExchangeD_01	Scabbs, have you always worked for SI:7?
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission7ExchangeF_03	Looks like he’ll eight-handle this.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission7ExchangeJ_01	There’s the shard! What? I can’t believe it.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission7ExchangeJ_02	The shard…is a piece of a naaru. The Night of Falling Stars…
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission7Victory_03	What?!
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_PreMission7_02	RICHES and GLORY! Oh, and the purple one wants to save her kid.\nLet’s do this!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission7ExchangeF_02	No, I’ll handle this!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission7ExchangeG_01	Not bad, gnome.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission7Victory_01	A piece of naaru? Just what I came for.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission7Loss_01	Xyrella? Xyrella!
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_PreMission7_01	The name’s Cutterbutter. Scabbs Cutterbutter. What brings a dwarf and draenei to the Barrens?
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Mission7ExchangeA_02	She always talk like this?
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Mission7ExchangeB_02	Don’t need to watch ‘em if I slice ‘em off!
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Mission7ExchangeC_01	Sushi’s up!
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Mission7ExchangeD_02	I never said I work for SI:7!
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Mission7ExchangeE_01	In my previous career, timing was everything. Lives hung in the balance with every swing of my knife. Fire was my best friend…
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Mission7ExchangeE_02	…I was a line cook!
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Mission7ExchangeF_01	I’ll handle this.
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Mission7ExchangeH_01	You’re just full of surprises, dwarf.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Mission7Victory_02	Well I’m also under orders to retrieve it.

VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission8Intro_01	Stay away from us.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission8ExchangeA_01	We can fight her off if we work together.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Mission8ExchangeD_02	Tavish?
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_PreMission8_01	I’m sorry, priestess. I’ve got to get this thing back to Stormwind.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission8ExchangeD_01	Ya can’t have the shard. It belongs to Xyrella.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Mission8Victory_02	And don’t come back!
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_PreMission8_02	Maybe we can work together. I’m also heading to the – hold up! We’ve got company.
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Mission8ExchangeB_01	Hoo hoo! Now THAT is an assassin.
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Mission8ExchangeC_01	Her knife skills are on point! Ha!
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Mission8ExchangeE_02	Press our advantage!
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission8Intro_02	Sorry. I’m only following orders.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission8ExchangeA_02	You don’t want to cross my blades.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission8ExchangeE_01	I…can’t fail.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission8Victory_01	I must retreat.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission8Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission8EmoteResponse_01	I’m here to hunt, not to chat.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission8HeroPower_01	The poison drips.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission8HeroPower_02	One cut is all I need.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission8HeroPower_03	The bane of kings…
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission8Loss_01	Finally. Kazakus will be pleased.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission8Idle_01	If only you knew what this blade has done.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission8Idle_02	Prepare for the end.
VO_Story_Hero_Garona_Female_Orc_Story_Xyrella_Mission8Idle_03	I will teach you fear.
	
	
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Select_01	I am Xyrella. When the Exodar crashed, my life was forever changed.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_HPHeal_01	I have got you.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_HPHeal_02	I will tend your wounds.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_HPHeal_03	Where does it hurt?
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_HPHeal_04	Let me help.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_HPHeal_05	How is that?
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_HPHeal_06	Feel better?
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_HPRez_01	On your feet!

VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_HPRez_05	I swore to keep you safe.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_HPRez_06	Come back to life!
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Xyrella_Ending_01	When I hold the shard I can hear its sisters cry out to me. Some are here…in the Barrens. When assembled, they will grant tremendous power.
	
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Attack_01	Lock and load.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Attack_02	Hold still.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Attack_03	I shoot first!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Death_01	Need healin’!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Death_02	Help!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Death_03	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_IsDead_01	Rez me, please!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_IsDead_02	Resurrect this dwarf!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_IsDead_03	Get me back in the fight.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Heal_01	Ahh.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Heal_02	That feels good.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Heal_03	Much better!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Heal_04	Holy Light kinda tickles.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Rez_01	Back in the battle!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Rez_02	Good as new!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Rez_03	Thanks, Xyrella.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Trigger_01	Here, catch!

VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Trigger_05	Another timely discovery.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Xyrella_Ending_03	What? I know mercs crawling all over to find them shards, and our employer is Lady Prestor.
	
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Attack_01	Slice and dice!

VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_IsDead_02	I’ve fallen, and I can’t get up!
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_IsDead_03	Bob never said it’d be like this.
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Heal_01	Nice!
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Heal_02	Ah, that’s better.
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Heal_03	Thanks, partner.
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Heal_04	That’s the stuff.
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Rez_01	I’m up! I’m up.
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Rez_02	Yes!
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Rez_03	I’ll get them this time!
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Trigger_01	Cloudy with a chance of daggers!
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Trigger_02	Assassinate!
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Trigger_03	A little espionage.
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Trigger_04	Knives rain!
VO_Story_Minion_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Trigger_05	Now you see me…now you don’t.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Xyrella_Ending_02	SI:7 was instructed to retrieve the shards by Lady Katrana Prestor, King Varian’s top advisor.

VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission1_01	Ten thousand years ago, the world had not yet changed.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission1_02	There was peace and prosperity in our forests, and the demigods still walked within them. From them, I learned all I needed to know.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission1Intro_02	I fear there is much left for me to master, shan'do.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission1ExchangeB_02	My brother is one of those…
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission1ExchangeC_02	I shall.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission1_Victory_02	You mean… antlers?
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Threaten_01	There is strength within me yet!
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission2_01	In his wisdom, Cenarius had seen the truth. Our world was torn apart by the demons' invasion. 
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission2_02	It was only with the aid of my reckless brother, Illidan, that our people survived. Although, I fear our memories of the war are quite different…
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission2Intro_03	So now you wish to help us, Illidan?
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission2ExchangeA_01	You are hardly even helping me, brother. 
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission2ExchangeB_02	They are using the Well of Eternity as their portal! We must destroy it!
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission2ExchangeC_03	I turned him into a tree. Where is the harm in that?
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission2ExchangeD_03	Powers of nature, answer my call!
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission3_01	Illidan's betrayal was only the beginning of his descent into darkness. He became angry and distant, blaming others for his own mistakes.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission3_02	When he attacked Jarod Shadowsong, I knew what must be done, though I would need the aid of my shan'do to do it.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission3ExchangeA_02	I saved everyone, and I appreciated your help, but now you are a danger to your own people!
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission3ExchangeB_01	There is no need for such rage. We have always loved and supported you!
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission3Victory_03	I have not forgotten his crimes, Maiev. He will be imprisoned…
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission4_01	We took the vials from Illidan and used them to create the World Tree Nordrassil.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission4_02	Blessed by the Dragon Aspects, it would be free from corruption, and undo my brother's greatest error.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission4_03	Afterward, I entered the realm of the Emerald Dream, healing the world for ten thousand years. But suddenly, I was awoken…
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission4Intro_02	Who are they?
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission4Intro_05	It seems the only chance for us is to unite against our enemies. Otherwise, all is lost...
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission4ExchangeA_02	No doubt Archimonde will make his way to Hyjal Summit and attack the World Tree. 
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission4ExchangeA_03	If he succeeds, we are doomed.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission4ExchangeE_01	To arms, my brethren! To arms, brave orcs and humans! 
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission4ExchangeE_02	Twilight falls—and the enemy awaits!
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission4ExchangeF_01	The World Tree granted us immortality and power over nature. Now, at last, it is time we gave that power back.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission4ExchangeF_03	If pride gives us pause, my love, then perhaps we have lived long enough already.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission4Victory_01	Yes. Now our victory is assured.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission5_01	In the chaos of Archimonde's war, Tyrande chose to free Illidan, hoping he would help us against the demons.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission5_02	Instead, he continued his dangerous pursuit of power, becoming ever more corrupted. Reluctantly, I banished him.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission5_03	Maiev went to recapture him, but soon called to us desperately for reinforcements.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5ExchangeA_02	I've come to stop you, Illidan. Again.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5Victory_01	I was lenient with you before, but no longer!
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission6_01	I continued to hunt my brother until, unexpectedly, he proved himself by saving Tyrande's life in battle.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission6_02	Whatever our differences had been, we agreed to part in peace. 
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission6_03	He left for Outland, and I was again called to the Emerald Dream, where I was captured within the Nightmare…
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission6Intro_02	So it is you, after all these years…
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission6ExchangeA_02	I am responsible for this blight, and I shall be its remedy.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission6ExchangeB_02	Broll! Where have you been?
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission6ExchangeB_04	I should like to hear it sometime.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission6Victory_02	We are rid of him!
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission7_01	After I vanquished the Nightmare, the world itself was seized by peril when Deathwing made his terrible return. 
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission7_02	The Shattering devastated our lands, bringing forth the elemental lord Ragnaros and his army of flame. I joined the Guardians of Hyjal to help defeat him.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission7Intro_02	Hamuul and I will do everything in our power.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission7ExchangeB_01	Defeat the sons of Ragnaros! Quickly!
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission8_01	Our triumph in Hyjal bought us years of peace as we tended the forests and protected the wild…
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_PreMission8_02	But war was again a visitor. It came first in Ashenvale, led by Warchief Sylvanas, who pressed the battle ever closer to our home in Teldrassil.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Intro_02	Begone from these lands! 
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission8ExchangeB_02	Impossible!
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission8ExchangeC_02	Aaagh!
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Victory_03	The war is lost. Teldrassil will soon fall. But this defeat is not forever.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Victory_04	So long as we live, the seeds of faith can yet be sown. 
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Victory_05	Our people have watched the world change… charred by destruction only to regrow more glorious than ever before…
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Victory_06	And we shall bear witness to it again. That is what I believe.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Story_Malfurion_Mission1Intro_01	Long have we trained, young Malfurion. Your skill has blossomed before me.
VO_Story_Hero_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Story_Malfurion_Mission1Intro_03	Then let us practice. 
VO_Story_Hero_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Story_Malfurion_Mission1ExchangeA_01	I have many students in my forest, yet none are like you.
VO_Story_Hero_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Story_Malfurion_Mission1ExchangeB_01	Some may pursue other forms of power, like the arcane. 
VO_Story_Hero_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Story_Malfurion_Mission1ExchangeB_02	But it is a foul affront to the might of nature.
VO_Story_Hero_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Story_Malfurion_Mission1ExchangeC_01	Do not let your brother dismay you but be prepared lest you need to intervene.
VO_Story_Hero_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Story_Malfurion_Mission1_Victory_01	Your growth pleases all the wild. Soon, you shall be blessed with a crown worthy of your studies.
VO_Story_Hero_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Story_Malfurion_Mission1_Victory_03	Of course. Maintain your focus well, thero'shan. You will need it in the days to come.
VO_Story_Hero_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Story_Malfurion_Mission1EmoteResponse_01	Listen to the wild…
VO_Story_Hero_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Story_Malfurion_Mission1HeroPower_03	Guard these lands!
VO_Story_Hero_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Story_Malfurion_Mission1Loss_01	I must become a better teacher to guide you forward.
VO_Story_Hero_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Story_Malfurion_Mission1Idle_01	All is in harmony under the trees.
VO_Story_Hero_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Story_Malfurion_Mission1Idle_02	Why do your people seek cities and palaces when there is shelter enough in nature?
VO_Story_Hero_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Story_Malfurion_Mission1Idle_03	Not all elves understand my ways as you do. I worry for them.
VO_Story_Hero_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Story_Malfurion_Mission7Intro_01	We must drive the Firelord from our realm!
VO_Story_Hero_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Story_Malfurion_Mission7ExchangeA_01	I call upon the chilling mountain winds!
VO_Story_Hero_Cenarius_Male_Demigod_Story_Malfurion_Mission7ExchangeD_01	The elementals have raged across Mount Hyjal since the Shattering… We must protect Nordrassil from their influence!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Story_Malfurion_Mission2Intro_01	All shall bow before the Burning Legion!
VO_Story_Hero_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Story_Malfurion_Mission2ExchangeC_01	You will suffer for what you did to Xavius…
VO_Story_Hero_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Story_Malfurion_Mission2Idle_01	You dare fight us now, when your own queen drew us to your world?
VO_Story_Hero_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Story_Malfurion_Mission2Idle_02	Resist if you want, but demons cannot truly die.
VO_Story_Hero_Mannoroth_Male_Demon_Story_Malfurion_Mission2Idle_03	Even your stalling is pitiful to me.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission2Intro_02	I am going to have to take exception to that!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission2Intro_04	I suppose.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission2Victory_03	I secretly saved a vial from the Well of Eternity.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission2Victory_04	You wouldn't understand. You aren't a mage!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission2ExchangeA_02	I wish that were true.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission2ExchangeD_02	Tyrande! No!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission3ExchangeB_02	HAH!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission3_Victory_01	You have made your point. What is to become of me? 
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission3EmoteResponse_01	Words cannot heal my wounds.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission3HeroPower_01	Do not tempt my rage!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission3HeroPower_02	I sacrificed everything!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission3HeroPower_03	There is nothing left for me to lose.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission3Loss_01	I never would have done this to you, brother. Not in ten thousand years.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission3Idle_01	What is it that really drives you to this, Malfurion? Are you jealous?
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission3Idle_02	I do not deserve to suffer simply because I chose a different path than you.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission3Idle_03	Have you even considered the pain I've been through? The loneliness?
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5Intro_01	Brother! What are you doing here?
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5ExchangeB_01	Tyrande! This battle does not concern you.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5ExchangeB_03	Monster? Is that what you think of me? I have always... cared about you, Tyrande. 
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5ExchangeB_04	I sought only to prove my worthiness—my power!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5ExchangeC_01	Soon you—and the whole world—will understand just what I'm capable of!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5_Victory_02	I have sworn allegiance to a new master, brother. I have a great task to perform in his service. 
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5_Victory_03	I'm sorry, but I cannot allow you to stand in my way.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5EmoteResponse_01	I cannot trust anything you say.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5HeroPower_01	I do not fear you.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5HeroPower_02	Hardly a challenge!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5HeroPower_03	My fate is my own!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5Loss_01	How many times must we fight to the end before you are satisfied?
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5Idle_01	Still you refuse to see me for what I truly am.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5Idle_02	Ten thousand years in darkness… only to fight with you again!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5Idle_03	I will take more care with my alliances from now on.
	
VO_Story_Minion_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission3_Victory_02	He attacked my brother. He cannot remain free!
VO_Story_Minion_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission3_Victory_04	And I will guard him.
VO_Story_Minion_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5ExchangeA_01	Tyrande, I'm surprised you came. Are you here to absolve your guilty conscience?
	
VO_Story_Minion_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission2ExchangeE_01	Back, you fiend!
VO_Story_Minion_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission4Intro_01	The Burning Legion has returned, and outlanders roam our sacred vales.
VO_Story_Minion_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission4ExchangeF_02	You realize that we will age as these mortals do…
VO_Story_Minion_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5ExchangeA_02	I did what I had to do, Maiev. You are in no position to judge me.
VO_Story_Minion_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission5ExchangeB_02	I was wrong to set you free, Illidan. You've become a monster.
VO_Story_Minion_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission8ExchangeD_02	No, the whole war was!
VO_Story_Minion_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Victory_02	I could say the same to you, orc.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Malfurion_Mission4Intro_03	I am Thrall, Warchief of the Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Thrall_Male_Orc_Story_Malfurion_Mission4Intro_07	In victory, or death!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Malfurion_Mission4Intro_04	And I am Jaina Proudmoore, leader of the survivors of Lordaeron.
VO_Story_Hero_Jaina_Female_Human_Story_Malfurion_Mission4Intro_06	We are with you!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Story_Malfurion_Mission6Intro_01	How I have waited for this… trapped in the shadows… growing my power.
VO_Story_Hero_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Story_Malfurion_Mission6ExchangeC_01	My legacy is to destroy all you have built, just as you destroyed our empire.
VO_Story_Hero_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Story_Malfurion_Mission6ExchangeD_01	It took thousands of years to corrupt the Emerald Dream… and endless effort…
VO_Story_Hero_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Story_Malfurion_Mission6ExchangeD_02	The only thing that sustained me was knowing how enraged you'd be that I still live.
VO_Story_Hero_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Story_Malfurion_Mission6_Victory_01	I will never leave you! I will ever be your nightmare…
VO_Story_Hero_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Story_Malfurion_Mission6EmoteResponse_01	No one hears your screams anymore.
VO_Story_Hero_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Story_Malfurion_Mission6HeroPower_01	Eternal slumber, eternal madness…
VO_Story_Hero_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Story_Malfurion_Mission6HeroPower_02	Never wake again!
VO_Story_Hero_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Story_Malfurion_Mission6HeroPower_03	No dreams, only nightmares…
VO_Story_Hero_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Story_Malfurion_Mission6Loss_01	The Nightmare never lets go of you…
VO_Story_Hero_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Story_Malfurion_Mission6Idle_01	I've corrupted many druids before you.
VO_Story_Hero_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Story_Malfurion_Mission6Idle_02	The Emerald Dream is weak and easily twisted.
VO_Story_Hero_Xavius_Male_Satyr_Story_Malfurion_Mission6Idle_03	If only you could be manipulated like your brother!
	
VO_Story_Minion_Ysera_Female_Dragon_Story_Malfurion_Mission6ExchangeA_01	Let no shadow linger in my domain!
VO_Story_Minion_Ysera_Female_Dragon_Story_Malfurion_Mission6_Victory_03	The Emerald Dream will heal… in time.
	
VO_Story_Minion_Broll_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission6ExchangeB_01	Malfurion, I am here for you!
VO_Story_Minion_Broll_Male_NightElf_Story_Malfurion_Mission6ExchangeB_03	It is a long story. There was a blood elf, an arena, and the king of Stormwind…
	
VO_Story_Minion_Hamuul_Male_Tauren_Story_Malfurion_Mission7Intro_03	I am ready, friends.
VO_Story_Minion_Hamuul_Male_Tauren_Story_Malfurion_Mission7ExchangeC_01	I require assistance!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Ragnaros_Male_Elemental_Story_Malfurion_Mission7Intro_04	FACE ME, INSECTS!!!
VO_Story_Hero_Ragnaros_Male_Elemental_Story_Malfurion_Mission7_Victory_01	YOU HAVE ONLY DELAYED THE INEVITABLE!
VO_Story_Hero_Ragnaros_Male_Elemental_Story_Malfurion_Mission7EmoteResponse_01	SILENCE, INSECT!
VO_Story_Hero_Ragnaros_Male_Elemental_Story_Malfurion_Mission7HeroPower_01	BE BATHED IN FLAME!
VO_Story_Hero_Ragnaros_Male_Elemental_Story_Malfurion_Mission7HeroPower_02	ASSIST ME, MY CHILDREN!
VO_Story_Hero_Ragnaros_Male_Elemental_Story_Malfurion_Mission7HeroPower_03	BURN IN LIQUID FIRE!
VO_Story_Hero_Ragnaros_Male_Elemental_Story_Malfurion_Mission7Loss_01	YOUR FAILURE HERALDS THE END OF YOUR WORLD!
VO_Story_Hero_Ragnaros_Male_Elemental_Story_Malfurion_Mission7Idle_01	THE SHATTERING WAS NOTHING COMPARED TO… THE ROASTING!
VO_Story_Hero_Ragnaros_Male_Elemental_Story_Malfurion_Mission7Idle_02	SAY THIS IS FINE… I DARE YOU!
VO_Story_Hero_Ragnaros_Male_Elemental_Story_Malfurion_Mission7Idle_03	YOUR WORLD TREE WILL BE KINDLING FOR MY FIRES!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Intro_01	You waste my time!
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Malfurion_Mission8ExchangeA_01	This battle cannot be won with wisps, Archdruid.
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Malfurion_Mission8ExchangeB_01	Keep trying to defy me. My power has far outgrown yours.
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Malfurion_Mission8ExchangeC_04	Finish him.
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Idle_01	I also fought to protect my land… It did not go as planned.
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Idle_02	Do not grieve. Your loved ones will always be with you.
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Idle_03	War always ends the same way.
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Malfurion_Mission8EmoteResponse_01	You underestimate me. Now you'll pay.
VO_Story_Hero_Sylvanas_Female_Undead_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Loss_01	All will serve me... in time.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Saurfang_Male_Orc_Story_Malfurion_Mission8ExchangeC_02	You do not fight alone, my lady.
VO_Story_Hero_Saurfang_Male_Orc_Story_Malfurion_Mission8ExchangeC_04	A dishonorable blow… I regret it.
VO_Story_Hero_Saurfang_Male_Orc_Story_Malfurion_Mission8ExchangeD_01	This battle has been poisoned by dishonor…
VO_Story_Hero_Saurfang_Male_Orc_Story_Malfurion_Mission8_Victory_01	I yield. Leave these lands, and you may survive.
VO_Story_Hero_Saurfang_Male_Orc_Story_Malfurion_Mission8EmoteResponse_01	Diplomacy is still not my strong suit.
VO_Story_Hero_Saurfang_Male_Orc_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Loss_01	A bad death in an unfair battle… I would take it back, if I could.
VO_Story_Hero_Saurfang_Male_Orc_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Idle_01	What would have happened if I let you kill the Dark Lady? I wonder…
VO_Story_Hero_Saurfang_Male_Orc_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Idle_02	There is nothing without honor. I must never forget that.
VO_Story_Hero_Saurfang_Male_Orc_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Idle_03	Even I do not know how far our Warchief will go in this war.
VO_Story_Hero_Saurfang_Male_Orc_Story_Malfurion_Mission8ExchangeE_01	I see now... this was not my place to intervene.
VO_Story_Hero_Saurfang_Male_Orc_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Idle_04	We all have to make our choices in this war.
VO_Story_Hero_Saurfang_Male_Orc_Story_Malfurion_Mission8Idle_05	I spill blood so that the Horde may endure. That is my sole purpose.

VO_Story_Hero_VoidNaralex_Male_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission8ExchangeC_01	THE DRAGONS WILL BURN THIS WORLD TO ASH.
VO_Story_Hero_VoidNaralex_Male_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission8ExchangeD_01	BLOCK OUT THE SUN.
VO_Story_Hero_VoidNaralex_Male_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission8ExchangeE_01	YOU ARE ALONE. YOU WILL DIE ALONE.
VO_Story_Hero_VoidNaralex_Male_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission8ExchangeF_01	FRIENDS?
VO_Story_Hero_VoidNaralex_Male_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission8ExchangeF_02	YOUR FRIENDS HAVE KILLED KIN. THEY WILL KILL AGAIN.
VO_Story_Hero_VoidNaralex_Male_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission8ExchangeG_01	CITIES WILL BURN BY THEIR HAND.
VO_Story_Hero_VoidNaralex_Male_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission8ExchangeH_01	ABANDON HOPE.
VO_Story_Hero_VoidNaralex_Male_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission8HeroPower_01	SLEEP NOW.

VO_Story_Hero_VoidNaralex_Male_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission8Intro_02	I AM THE VOID!
VO_Story_Hero_VoidNaralex_Male_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission8Loss_01	SLEEP WELL.

VO_Story_Hero_Barak_Male_Centaur_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeA_01	The Kolkar will trample your bones to dust!
VO_Story_Hero_Barak_Male_Centaur_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeC_01	Stop that! You turn the wilds against us!
VO_Story_Hero_Barak_Male_Centaur_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeD_01	Why are you here?
VO_Story_Hero_Barak_Male_Centaur_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeE_01	Do you hear the wail of the caverns? They will be your undoing.
VO_Story_Hero_Barak_Male_Centaur_Story_Guff_Mission3HeroPower_01	<_Hostile neighing_>
VO_Story_Hero_Barak_Male_Centaur_Story_Guff_Mission3HeroPower_02	This land is mine!
VO_Story_Hero_Barak_Male_Centaur_Story_Guff_Mission3HeroPower_03	Prepare to suffer.
VO_Story_Hero_Barak_Male_Centaur_Story_Guff_Mission3Idle_01	Don’t trot on me.
VO_Story_Hero_Barak_Male_Centaur_Story_Guff_Mission3Idle_02	<_Impatient snort_>
VO_Story_Hero_Barak_Male_Centaur_Story_Guff_Mission3Idle_03	What are you waiting for? Fight me!
VO_Story_Hero_Barak_Male_Centaur_Story_Guff_Mission3Intro_01	Death to the Horde!
VO_Story_Hero_Barak_Male_Centaur_Story_Guff_Mission3Loss_01	And now we ride to the Crossroads!
VO_Story_Hero_Barak_Male_Centaur_Story_Guff_Mission3Victory_01	Corruption bleeds from the caverns. The void will consume all.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeA_Brukan_01	You still have much to learn, and I much to teach.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeD_Brukan_01	Bubbles emerge from those fissures – something must lie within!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeF_Brukan_02	Is that a shard of the light I see?
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeG_Brukan_02	My young friend, I but wield nature. You are nature.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_01	Call the lightning!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_02	Don’t mess with my tauren!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_03	For the Darkspear!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_04	Age before beauty.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_05	<_Laughs_>
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_06	<_Cheers_>
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeB_Brukan_01	At this rate, we will never defeat the Kolkar army.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeE_Brukan_02	Do not listen to this Kolkar.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeF_Brukan_01	You are more clever than you let on, my humble friend.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission4ExchangeB_Brukan_02	You must not know much about the Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission4ExchangeC_Brukan_02	These beings are corrupted, whether of shell, or fang, or wing, or talon.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeC_Brukan_01	What troubles you, my young friend?
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeD_Brukan_01	Things weigh heavily on you. You are a druid. You are a Runetotem. There is power in your heart. Use it!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeD_Brukan_02	Now kindly taste one of those cave mushrooms. I want to know if they are safe to eat.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission6ExchangeD_Brukan_02	I am the earth…the water…They are…venom. It is…unnatural.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission6ExchangeE_Brukan_01	These coldblooded fiends must not defeat us.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission7ExchangeA_01	Mutanus…the Devourer! But it was only a legend.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission7ExchangeC_Brukan_01	Stay focused. No mistakes. Fight with all your heart.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission8ExchangeF_03	Do not listen to him, Guff!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_Mission8Victory_01	Archdruid Runetotem, your great nephew Guff has purified the shard of naaru and rid the Barrens of this corruption. It was his kind heart and gentle soul that saved us all.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_PreMission3_02	Kolkar centaurs run rampant in Lushwater, and they detest the Horde. This trip will be very dangerous.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_PreMission6_03	Guff – wait! Get away from her!
VO_Story_Hero_Smythe_Male_Human_Story_Guff_Mission4Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Smythe_Male_Human_Story_Guff_Mission4EmoteResponse_01	Those will be your last words.
VO_Story_Hero_Smythe_Male_Human_Story_Guff_Mission4ExchangeA_01	Begone, vile Horde wretches. This doesn’t concern you.
VO_Story_Hero_Smythe_Male_Human_Story_Guff_Mission4ExchangeB_01	One day the Alliance will control all of Kalimdor.
VO_Story_Hero_Smythe_Male_Human_Story_Guff_Mission4ExchangeD_02	If Paladin Roame was here, you wouldn’t stand a chance.
VO_Story_Hero_Smythe_Male_Human_Story_Guff_Mission4HeroPower_01	<_Cannonball SFX reuse_>
VO_Story_Hero_Smythe_Male_Human_Story_Guff_Mission4Idle_01	We are the finest the Alliance has to offer.
VO_Story_Hero_Smythe_Male_Human_Story_Guff_Mission4Idle_02	You are Horde scum.
VO_Story_Hero_Smythe_Male_Human_Story_Guff_Mission4Idle_03	It is painful to watch you think.
VO_Story_Hero_Smythe_Male_Human_Story_Guff_Mission4Intro_01	Light those cannons, boys. We’re gonna blow these turtles all to shell!
VO_Story_Hero_Smythe_Male_Human_Story_Guff_Mission4Loss_01	Tie them up. It’s a long walk back to Northwatch.
VO_Story_Hero_DeadlyAdventurer_Female_Human_Story_Guff_Mission5Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_DeadlyAdventurer_Female_Human_Story_Guff_Mission5EmoteResponse_01	There are more of us than there are of you.
VO_Story_Hero_DeadlyAdventurer_Female_Human_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeA_02	No…but your gear looks like it would make pretty good loot!
VO_Story_Hero_DeadlyAdventurer_Female_Human_Story_Guff_Mission5Idle_01	Does your healer need more mana?
VO_Story_Hero_DeadlyAdventurer_Female_Human_Story_Guff_Mission5Intro_02	The treasure in this cavern is ours!
VO_Story_Hero_DeadlyAdventurer_Female_Human_Story_Guff_Mission5Loss_01	All right. Let’s loot. And remember, everyone roll greed.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission1ExchangeA_01	I…kind of…summoned a whole bunch of treants and they were pretty mad and then they knocked over the great tent.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission1ExchangeD_02	I wanted to prove that I’m a hero too!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission1ExchangeE_01	I want to save this land, Uncle.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission1Intro_01	There’s the big treant I summoned, Uncle! The one with the cute face.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission1Victory_01	I did it! I stopped the treant attack.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeA_01	Woohoo! Let’s do it.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeB_01	Uncle Hamuul told the other adventurers to search the pools for the source of the purification.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeB_02	But I love swimming, so it’s all upside! Cannonball!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeC_02	Is there a third option?
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeD_02	Sounds scientific. Guess I’ll bash my head into it!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeF_03	The shard must be breathing new life into this land.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeG_Brukan_01	You are mighty, Bru’kan. You are deeply in touch with the Earth Mother.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeG_Brukan_03	Sometimes…nature calls…to me.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeG_Dawngrasp_01	You are so powerful, Dawngrasp. How did you get so strong?
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeG_Dawngrasp_03	Not so innocent. One time I stepped barehoof on a thornbush and did not apologize to the thornbush.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeG_Rokara_02	I fight to protect nature – every butterfly…and every flower.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeG_Rokara_03	I mean the kind you smell, not make cakes with. Although, I would fight with every bone in my tauren body to protect cakes.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeG_Tamsin_01	It seems you really enjoy fighting with imps, Miss Tamsin.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeG_Tamsin_03	That sounds kind of…cold.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission2Intro_01	We must find the source of this pure water.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission2Victory_01	It appears the shards of fractured naaru are returning life to this Barren land.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeA_02	But I like my bones! They’re what separate me from rogue armor.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeB_02	I do not like to fight, but…maybe the kodo can help us.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeC_02	Leave this peaceful place!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeD_02	That is none of your concern.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeF_02	The kodo will not stand for hatred, and neither will I!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission3Intro_02	Or maybe we could hang out, with no death?
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission3Victory_02	The Wailing Caverns are close by. They say strange creatures live inside.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission3Victory_03	I cannot wait to meet them!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission4ExchangeA_02	These snapjaws are under MY protection.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission4ExchangeC_01	I like the beasts of Wailing Caverns. They’re cute! Hey fella.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission4ExchangeD_01	I will run you from these caverns, and then this land.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission4Intro_02	You leave those wee turtles alone!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission4Victory_01	These caverns are filled with poisonous beasts, flying snakes, and carnivorous raptors, yet the humans are the most monstrous creatures here.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeA_01	Maybe we can all work together. Do you need any Refreshing Spring Water?
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeB_01	The caverns are dangerous. I can protect your retreat, but you should go now.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeC_02	I do not know…Sometimes I wonder…what am I even good for?
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeD_Dawngrasp_02	You are right. How did you get to be so smart?
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeD_Rokara_02	No, you are right. We are strong!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeD_Tamsin_03	Thank you, Tamsin. That was almost like a compliment.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission5Intro_01	We do not want to fight. We are just passing through.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission5Victory_01	That’s right, get out of here! You’ll probably be safer on the surface anyway!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission6Intro_01	We want to stop the corruption of nature.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission7ExchangeB_02	Stay BACK! You will not harm my friends.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission7ExchangeD_01	Where is the shard of naaru? Did he eat it? Do the shards taste good?
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission7Intro_02	Easy, boy. Easy! I do not want to hurt you.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission8ExchangeE_02	You are wrong. I have something the Void can never claim – my friends!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission8ExchangeH_02	No! You are a druid, like me. I will wake you from this nightmare. I can save you!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission8ExchangeJ_01	It is working! The shard…look! The Light returns.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission8Intro_01	I will free you from the Void.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission8Victory_03	I could never have done it alone. As the great trees are made stronger by their grove, so am I made stronger by my friends. Plus, my friends are much nicer to hug! C’mere!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_PreMission1_02	Um, Uncle Archdruid? Hi. Sorry to interrupt, but I, uh, summoned a bunch of treants and now we have a little problem.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_PreMission2_01	Uncle Hamuul sure was mad, but I had to prove myself to him anyway.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_PreMission2_02	A mystery of nature was right in front of me! I met up with my best friends in the Barrens at an oasis that had been mysteriously purified.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_PreMission2_03	My friends are the best. A while back we fought a robot and met some dwarves and found a pretty shard of light! I knew they could help me in my quest.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_PreMission3_03	I know Lushwater like the back of my hoof. You say danger – I say fun!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_PreMission4_01	This was my chance to prove myself! Outside Wailing Caverns, that troll Kazakus was waiting for us. Why does that guy always show up out of nowhere at the strangest times?
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_PreMission4_03	Inside the caverns, we found some Alliance soldiers using a nest of sweet snapjaws for target practice. You can guess how I felt about that.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_PreMission5_01	Did we make a wrong turn? Maybe Uncle Hamuul was right. Maybe I should have left this task to real adventurers.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_PreMission6_02	You’re druids? I’m a druid! Maybe you can help us. We’re searching Wailing Caverns for a shard of naaru.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_PreMission7_02	Stand with me, everyone. I can stop it. I know I can.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_PreMission7_03	What-what is that?
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_PreMission8_02	The Eternal Sun shines upon you. I do not know what happened to this shard of Light, but I can fix it.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_PreMission8_03	I will wake you from this nightmare.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Select_01	I’m Guff! And this is my adventure! Push the big button and we can start. But don’t push too hard. Last time I broke it.
VO_Story_Hero_Hamuul_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission1ExchangeA_02	Oh, great-nephew…not again…
VO_Story_Hero_Hamuul_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission1ExchangeB_01	You have lost control of your treants. They are pummeling Thunder Bluff!
VO_Story_Hero_Hamuul_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission1ExchangeC_01	Protect our home! Stop those treants, at any cost.
VO_Story_Hero_Hamuul_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission1ExchangeD_01	Why can’t you just stay in your home and not touch anything and not talk to anyone like we discussed?
VO_Story_Hero_Hamuul_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission1ExchangeE_02	But who is going to save us from you?
VO_Story_Hero_Hamuul_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission1ExchangeF_01	Guff…look what you’ve done!
VO_Story_Hero_Hamuul_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission1ExchangeG_01	That building contained priceless artifacts.
VO_Story_Hero_Hamuul_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission1ExchangeH_01	The city is in shambles.
VO_Story_Hero_Hamuul_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission1ExchangeJ_01	How will we ever recover?
VO_Story_Hero_Hamuul_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission1Victory_02	That you started. Guff, please, stay out of this business in the Barrens.
VO_Story_Hero_Hamuul_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission8Victory_02	It seems I was wrong about you, Guff. I owe you an apology.
VO_Story_Hero_Hamuul_Male_Tauren_Story_Guff_PreMission1_01	I am Hamuul Runetotem, Archdruid of Thunder Bluff. I call you, brave adventurers, to seek out the oases that have appeared in the Barrens and find the source of this new life.
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Guff_PreMission4_02	Beware the Druids of the Fang who lurk within the caverns. Seek the shard and bring it to me…at any cost.
VO_Story_Hero_Anacondra_Female_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission6Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Anacondra_Female_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission6EmoteResponse_01	Our fangs are sharp!
VO_Story_Hero_Anacondra_Female_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission6ExchangeA_01	This arid land was once verdant and pure, the jewel of the continent.
VO_Story_Hero_Anacondra_Female_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission6ExchangeB_01	Our leader, Naralex, sssought to ressstore the Barrens to its former beauty with the power of the Emerald Dream.
VO_Story_Hero_Anacondra_Female_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission6ExchangeB_02	But that dream became a Nightmare.
VO_Story_Hero_Anacondra_Female_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission6ExchangeC_01	I found this shard of which you speak. We Fanglords thought the shard’s power could awaken our massster.
VO_Story_Hero_Anacondra_Female_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission6ExchangeC_02	But the Nightmare claimed the shard as well. The corruption ssspreads. It cannot be ssstopped!
VO_Story_Hero_Anacondra_Female_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission6ExchangeD_01	You cannot ssstop us! You will all die in these caverns!
VO_Story_Hero_Anacondra_Female_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission6HeroPower_01	<_Hiss_>
VO_Story_Hero_Anacondra_Female_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission6Idle_01	You cannot escape.

VO_Story_Hero_Anacondra_Female_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission6Intro_02	Impossssible.
VO_Story_Hero_Anacondra_Female_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission6Loss_01	The Nightmare never ends.
VO_Story_Hero_Anacondra_Female_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission6Victory_01	Our master is just ahead. You will join him in his Nightmare!
VO_Story_Hero_Anacondra_Female_NightElf_Story_Guff_PreMission6_01	We are the Druids of the Fang. You don’t belong here.

VO_Story_Hero_RelentlessAdventurer_Female_Tauren_Story_Guff_Mission5Intro_02	The treasure in this cavern is ours!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeA_Rokara_01	Let’s fight together, Guff!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeD_Rokara_01	Check it out, Guff! Gases are bubbling out of that fissure.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeF_Rokara_02	Look! Another shard.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeG_Rokara_01	I fight for honor and to protect the Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_01	Strength and honor!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_02	I got you, Guff.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_03	Shield of the Horde!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_04	Learned this move back in Alterac.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_05	Never waver.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_06	<_Cheers_>
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeB_Rokara_01	There are too many of them. We need to even the odds.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeE_Rokara_02	Don’t listen to him, Guff.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeF_Rokara_01	Press the advantage. Great job, Guff!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission4ExchangeB_Rokara_02	You must not know much about the Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission4ExchangeC_Rokara_02	I suppose…if you think slippery scales and cold reptilian eyes are cute.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeC_Rokara_01	You all right, Guff?
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeD_Rokara_01	Never doubt your honor, Guff. You are brave and kind. I protect others, just like you. Does that make me weak?
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission6ExchangeD_Rokara_02	I am no friend of the Alliance, but these night elves are something else entirely. Something twisted.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission6ExchangeE_Rokara_01	Fanglords. Why’d it have to be Fanglords?
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission7ExchangeC_Rokara_01	Come on, everyone. We can do this. For the Horde!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_Mission8ExchangeG_03	Literally no one is looking at you, Tamsin.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_Story_Guff_PreMission5_02	Don’t lose hope, Guff. We never would have gotten past those Kolkar without you. Let’s keep moving.
VO_Story_Hero_SneakyAdventurer_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeB_03	Heh, heh. I don’t think so.
VO_Story_Hero_SneakyAdventurer_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission5Idle_02	Is someone AFK?
VO_Story_Hero_SwiftAdventurer_Male_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeB_02	What, so you can keep all the treasure?
VO_Story_Hero_SwiftAdventurer_Male_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission5Idle_03	Gogogogogo.
VO_Story_Hero_SwiftAdventurer_Male_NightElf_Story_Guff_Mission5Intro_02	The treasure in this cavern is ours!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeA_Tamsin_01	Look at us, a master of life, and a mistress of death.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeD_Tamsin_01	I sense great power within that underwater vent. Destroy it. I must know what’s inside.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeF_Tamsin_02	A shard was in the fissure?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeG_Tamsin_02	Oh, yes, my little funnel cake.  I could only ever love something both stupid and expendable.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeG_Tamsin_04	Aww…I love you too, Guff.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_01	Scamper, my pretty.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_02	Watch out, cow man.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_03	Go! Bite!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_04	Impressive.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_05	Most impressive.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_06	<_Cheers_>
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeB_Tamsin_01	Crush those vile Kolkar.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeE_Tamsin_02	Ignore this fool. 
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeF_Tamsin_01	Such a clever boy – using the beasts to your advantage.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission4ExchangeB_Tamsin_02	The Alliance couldn’t even control all of Lordaeron.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission4ExchangeC_Tamsin_02	No, they’re ugly. Just like us.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeC_Tamsin_01	Why do you hesitate, Cow Man?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeD_Tamsin_01	You’re eight feet tall! Wild beasts obey your commands! 
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeD_Tamsin_02	Sure, your power pales in comparison to my own, but you are good for so much, Guff…as my henchman.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission6ExchangeD_Tamsin_02	I have one question for you, snake – who does your wardrobe?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission6ExchangeE_Tamsin_01	That one might tip the scales.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission7ExchangeA_02	A living legend.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission7ExchangeC_Tamsin_01	Must we harm such a beautiful creature?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Guff_Mission8ExchangeG_02	Why are you all looking at me?
VO_Story_Hero_Vapos_Male_Elemental_Story_Guff_Mission1Intro_02	The elements are the source of all things.
VO_Story_Hero_Vapos_Male_Elemental_Story_Guff_Mission2Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Vapos_Male_Elemental_Story_Guff_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	I will drag you down.
VO_Story_Hero_Vapos_Male_Elemental_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeC_01	I am the sentry of this land. Flee or die.
VO_Story_Hero_Vapos_Male_Elemental_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeE_01	Leave my power be!
VO_Story_Hero_Vapos_Male_Elemental_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeF_01	Nooo!

VO_Story_Hero_Vapos_Male_Elemental_Story_Guff_Mission2Idle_01	For what do you search?
VO_Story_Hero_Vapos_Male_Elemental_Story_Guff_Mission2Idle_02	Such a band of misfits.
VO_Story_Hero_Vapos_Male_Elemental_Story_Guff_Mission2Idle_03	Do you feel the power?
VO_Story_Hero_Vapos_Male_Elemental_Story_Guff_Mission2Loss_01	Stay away…
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeA_Dawngrasp_01	A couple of misfits, just you and me, Guff.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeD_Dawngrasp_01	A fissure! Guff, that gas vent may be the source of this new life. Please investigate.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeF_Dawngrasp_02	It’s another shard of naaru.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission2ExchangeG_Dawngrasp_02	Years of study. I have analyzed that your strength comes naturally from your innocent heart.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_01	Like my new sculpture?
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_02	Hey Guff! Do you like ice in your drink?
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_03	Seize the day!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_04	Glory to the sin’dorei!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_05	Face my frost!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission2HeroPower_06	<_Cheers_>
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission2Victory_02	I know where we must go next. If you all would indulge me, I’d like to conduct an experiment.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeB_Dawngrasp_01	So many Kolkar. We must thin their numbers.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeE_Dawngrasp_02	He provides no evidence.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission3ExchangeF_Dawngrasp_01	Your moves are quite unorthodox, Guff, but I cannot dispute their effectiveness.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission4ExchangeB_Dawngrasp_02	You must not know much about the Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission4ExchangeC_Dawngrasp_02	I suppose they possess a rather humble beauty.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission4Victory_02	And yet they call us monsters. Let us continue on. We need to find the source of the corruption.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeC_Dawngrasp_01	Guff, what’s wrong? I’ve never seen you look sad before.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeD_Dawngrasp_01	It is good to question, but you must be true to who you are. Nobody knows that better than me.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission5ExchangeD_Dawngrasp_03	I read a lot of books.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission6ExchangeD_Dawngrasp_02	I fear something terrible has happened to the shard of naaru.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission6ExchangeE_Dawngrasp_01	I’ll never understand what Lord Kael’thas saw in creatures such as these.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_Mission7ExchangeC_Dawngrasp_01	This murloc is of incalculable size. Think of what it must eat!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_PreMission3_01	Let us hurry to Lushwater Oasis. If my hypothesis is correct, other shards will be nearby.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Guff_PreMission7_01	The shard is just ahead. It seems to be the source of the corruption.

VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_ERROR_STEALTH_01	Someone's playing tricksy.
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_ERROR_SUMMON_SICKNESS_01	Give that one a turn! They just got here.
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_ERROR_TARGET_01	I cannot attack that!
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_ERROR_TAUNT_01	But that other one has the shieldy thing.
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_FACTION_CRY_01	For the Horde!

VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_HAPPY_EVENT_01	What a happy time this is!

VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_PARTY_01	Let us party! I know a great band.
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_Picked_01	I don't like to fight, but if you hurt nature I'll stand in your way.
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_PIRATE_DAY_01	Pirates are scary, but their peg legs are fun to talk to.
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_SALUTE_01	I bow my horns to you, friend.
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_Sorry_01	Oh, sorry!

VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_TRIGGER_FORCEOFNATURE_01	Have you met my tree friends?
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_TRIGGER_GUFFSBIZARREADVENTURE_01	Once upon a time…
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_TRIGGER_LIVINGSEED_01	I call to you my animal friends!
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_TRIGGER_NOURISH_01	All good options.
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_TRIGGER_POUNCE_01	I am agile!
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_TRIGGER_SEASWELL_01	Hoohoo! Look at the size of them!
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_TRIGGER_THORNGROWTHSENTRIES_01	Look at the tiny turtles!
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_TRIGGER_WILDGROWTH_01	From the smallest seed…
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_VALENTINES_01	Love is in the air…in the form of pollen, of course.
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_WELCOME_01	Welcome! I put out the fire because the logs asked me to.
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_Well_Played_01	That was fun!
VO_HERO_06j_Male_Tauren_WOW_01	Whoa.

VO_Story_Hero_Aranna_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Aranna_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	Trust in Lord Illidan’s plan.
VO_Story_Hero_Aranna_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2ExchangeA_01	I’m sorry. I was told to convince you…with my glaive if I must.
VO_Story_Hero_Aranna_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2ExchangeC_02	We have all lost much, but…we are your family now. Do not abandon us.
VO_Story_Hero_Aranna_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2ExchangeD_02	Then I know what I must do…and it breaks my heart.
VO_Story_Hero_Aranna_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2ExchangeE_01	You’ve been training, I see. And you've constructed your own warglaives.
VO_Story_Hero_Aranna_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2ExchangeF_01	I will show you what we can do when we work together.
VO_Story_Hero_Aranna_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2HeroPower_01	By my blades…
VO_Story_Hero_Aranna_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2HeroPower_02	You are not my enemy, but –
VO_Story_Hero_Aranna_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2HeroPower_03	Run for your life!
VO_Story_Hero_Aranna_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2Idle_01	Your new friend reminds me of myself.
VO_Story_Hero_Aranna_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2Idle_02	Please, Kurtrus, don’t make me do this.
VO_Story_Hero_Aranna_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2Idle_03	Let me help you.
VO_Story_Hero_Aranna_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2Intro_01	Ashfallen! Shan’do demands your presence at the Black Temple.
VO_Story_Hero_Aranna_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2Loss_01	Come with me now, Kurtrus. Lord Illidan is waiting.
VO_Story_Hero_Aranna_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2Victory_01	I must withdraw. You will not return with us?
VO_Story_Hero_Aranna_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2Victory_03	Then…if we do not meet again…die well.
VO_Story_Hero_Samuro_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Samuro_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1EmoteResponse_01	You face the shogun of Orgrimmar!
VO_Story_Hero_Samuro_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1ExchangeA_02	You are a long way from Stormwind, human.
VO_Story_Hero_Samuro_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1ExchangeB_02	I hope they try.
VO_Story_Hero_Samuro_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1HeroPower_01	Taste my blade!
VO_Story_Hero_Samuro_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1HeroPower_02	Ha ha! BLADESTORM!
VO_Story_Hero_Samuro_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1HeroPower_03	Meet your death!
VO_Story_Hero_Samuro_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1Idle_01	Without a hand to wield it, even the sharpest blade is worthless.
VO_Story_Hero_Samuro_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1Idle_02	True patience requires bearing the unbearable.
VO_Story_Hero_Samuro_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1Idle_03	I fight for the honor of my clan.
VO_Story_Hero_Samuro_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1Intro_02	Begone, demon! This does not concern you.
VO_Story_Hero_Samuro_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1Loss_01	Dying to a blademaster is a great honor!
VO_Story_Hero_Samuro_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1Victory_01	Fall back. Fall back! Keep our blades sharp for another fight.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1ExchangeB_01	I will fight to my last breath. And know this — my comrades at Northwatch will avenge me!
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1ExchangeC_02	Demon armies? I’m just on patrol out here.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1ExchangeD_03	Who in the Light’s name is Anetheron? 
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1ExchangeF_02	I’m also looking for someone. If we get out of this alive, we should travel together — help each other.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1ExchangeG_01	You’re pretty good.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1ExchangeH_01	You should get a real weapon.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1Victory_02	I am Cariel Roame of the Silver Hand, stationed at Northwatch. You have my thanks and my hammer. Lead on.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2ExchangeB_01	This lady a friend of yours?
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3ExchangeB_01	Is this the warlock you’re after?
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3ExchangeD_02	My sister. I thought she died during the Third War, but someone matching her description was sighted in the Barrens.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3ExchangeE_01	I’ve been tracking my sister’s movements. When you and I met, I was on my way to Dreadmist Peak to look for her.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3Victory_01	Kurtrus…there’s something you should know.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3Victory_02	I…abandoned my post at Northwatch. The Silver Hand – they’re going to be pretty mad…but I had to find my sister.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4ExchangeB_01	Nice moves, gnome! You must be in SI:7. I’m with the Silver Hand.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeB_Cariel_01	Kurtrus – that demon…is that…him?
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeC_Cariel_01	I stand against darkness, so I will stand against you!
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeD_Cariel_01	We will find my sister and avenge your family; I am sure of it.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5Victory_02	Kurtrus, wait. We need to regain our strength. Let’s take shelter in one of the mountain caves. At dawn, we rise…and fight!
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeA_Cariel_01	This troll gives me the creeps.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeG_Cariel_01	Crafty fiend! Fight us head on!
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeH_Cariel_01	By the Holy Light!
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeM_Cariel_01	Surrender, then.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6Victory_03	We should take the mage back to Stormwind to stand trial and face justice.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7ExchangeB_01	These cultists are enemies of the Light.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7ExchangeB_03	Her? Her who?
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7Victory_02	S-sister?!
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeA_01	Sister! What has happened to you?
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeB_02	I can’t let you hurt her. She’s my sister!
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeC_01	Tamsin, speak true – are you allied with the Burning Blade?
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeD_01	Thank goodness. Kurtrus thought you were trying to summon the dreadlord Anetheron.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeE_02	Let me fix this. I thought she was dead!
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeF_02	I’m ready. I fight for my family.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission3_01	Are you all right? Do you want to talk about your friend?
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission5_03	Kurtrus – we’ve got company.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission7_02	I have a bad feeling…like my sister is close, but there’s something off…wrong…
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission8_02	My sister is not the warlock you seek. Please, Kurtrus. You are my comrade, but I will fight you if I have to.
VO_Story_Hero_Child_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission1_05	An’da!
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6EmoteResponse_01	The shard’s power is beyond your understanding.
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeB_01	Your draenei has a shard of Light. It is a trifle – but I need it.
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeC_01	I can help you eradicate the Burning Blade.
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeD_01	Surely I can pay you for the artifact. Name your price.
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeE_03	Silence!
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeF_01	I will show you the power of the shards!
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeJ_01	They are strong when they fight as one. So be it. Dawngrasp – cover my retreat.
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6HeroPower_01	I have many tricks.
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6HeroPower_02	Glory? I bottle it.
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6HeroPower_03	Have a potion!
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6Idle_01	Give me the shard.
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6Idle_02	Why do you hesitate?
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6Idle_03	That shard…I can FEEL its power.
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6Intro_01	Perhaps I could help you…reach the summit?
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6Loss_01	This was all avoidable.
VO_Story_Hero_Kazakus_Male_Troll_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission6_03	In that case…Hello. I am Kazakus, and I would like to speak to you about your shard of naaru.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1ExchangeA_01	Those orcs have that paladin surrounded.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1ExchangeC_01	I will aid you, paladin. You are an enemy of the demon armies, are you not?
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1ExchangeD_01	I am Kurtrus Ashfallen, wayward deserter of the Illidari, survivor of the Felwood, and hunter of demons… 
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1ExchangeD_02	I have returned to Azeroth to stop Anetheron at any cost.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1ExchangeE_01	Anetheron…Nathrezim Dreadlord of the Burning Legion, emissary of Archimonde, and brother of Tichondrius.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1ExchangeE_02	He destroyed…everything I hold dear.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1ExchangeF_01	There is a warlock in the Barrens who seeks to bring Anetheron back to this realm. I must find and stop this warlock.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1ExchangeG_02	 Your moves are also…effective.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1ExchangeH_02	This will do.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission1Intro_01	Ah! Where am I? Back on Azeroth.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2ExchangeA_02	My fight is not with you, Aranna…or with Illidan.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2ExchangeB_02	A fellow demon hunter and full-fledged Illidari. One of the finest.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2ExchangeC_01	What would you do, Aranna? I must have vengeance for my family.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2ExchangeD_01	I am sorry. I cannot live until he dies.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2Intro_02	I will not return until Anetheron is destroyed.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission2Victory_02	No.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3ExchangeB_02	No. To summon Anetheron would require power to rival that of the lich Kel’Thuzad.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3ExchangeC_01	On the other hand, this quilboar will provide an adequate warm up...and perhaps some information.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3ExchangeD_01	What are you looking for out here, paladin?
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3ExchangeE_02	A cult allied with demons occupies Dreadmist Peak. Perhaps it is fate that we are going to the same place.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3Intro_01	Stop right there, warlock.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3Victory_03	Cariel…I understand. Like you, I put family above all else.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4ExchangeA_02	A naaru? Here, on Azeroth?
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4ExchangeD_01	Could a shard of naaru summon a dreadlord? Priestess, help me crush this evil cult and retrieve the shard of naaru!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4Intro_01	We will help you turn the tide of this battle, friends.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4Victory_01	Our arrival has not gone unnoticed. We have stepped in the ant mound, and now the insects will launch an attack.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4Victory_02	As we ascend the peak we must be cautious. Stay close to me, all of you.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeA_01	Where is the warlock who seeks to return Anetheron to this world?
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeB_Cariel_02	No. Anetheron is much – MUCH – bigger.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeB_Scabbs_01	You would let them live?
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeB_Xyrella_02	After all you have survived, how are you still so kind?
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeD_01	I am glad to have you by my side.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5Intro_02	I am a demon hunter. I hunt demons.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5Victory_01	We have routed the enemy. Now we move, to the summit!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeC_02	We don’t need your help.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeE_01	You heard the woman. Leave now or suffer the consequences.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeF_02	I will show you my power.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeL_02	You should have thought of that before allying yourself with that monster.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6Intro_02	What is the catch?
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6Victory_01	The enemy is subdued. Now we must decide what to do with them. Xyrella, are you all right?
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7ExchangeA_02	If you insist.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7ExchangeC_01	I have journeyed between worlds, forged this weapon, climbed this mountain – nothing will keep me from my goal, least of all you, orc!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7Intro_01	Where is the warlock that seeks Anetheron’s return?
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeB_01	Get out of my way.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeB_03	She is the warlock I have been after all this time; I am sure of it.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeE_01	Now do you see? She admits it.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeF_01	I do not want to fight you, paladin, but I will not let you stop me.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeG_01	Now…no one to protect you.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeH_01	You speak without honor. She is your sister.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8Intro_02	Bite your tongue, Forsaken wretch! I will deal with you in a moment.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8Victory_01	At last! Now yield.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8Victory_03	No! Warlock – get back here. I’m not finished. No!!!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission1_04	In my dreams…they are still alive.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission2_01	Our pace across the Barrens was swift. It was a dreadful land of centaur, quilboar, harpy, and orc – all claiming ownership of the desolate place…and marking their territory with blood.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission2_02	The Horde would never catch us, but I had far more capable pursuers to contend with – themselves outcasts who had come a long way.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission3_02	My only friend is the carnage I will bring down upon Anetheron.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission3_03	Look ahead. A warlock on the road. Keep your libram close, paladin.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission4_01	We cut the quickest path to Dreadmist Peak, staying clear of settlements and other travelers.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission4_02	At the foot of the mountain, we discovered an eccentric trio of adventurers who had run afoul of a local mage with a nefarious agenda.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission5_01	These shards you speak of – the fractured naaru – I now believe this power is what the warlock seeks to bring Anetheron back. I cannot let that happen.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission6_01	We made camp in a cave on the mountainside and set a watch. In the middle of the night, a pair of unexpected visitors appeared. Unexpected…and unwanted.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission7_01	With the battle done, Xyrella and her companions returned to Stormwind with the sin’dorei mage in tow. Cariel and I made for the summit with weapons drawn, ready for anything.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission7_03	Failure is the only thing we have to fear – failure to destroy the warlock that seeks to return Anetheron to this world.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission8_01	Step aside, Cariel. My mission must be completed. I will not hesitate to strike down ANYONE who gets in my way.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_Select_01	After the Third War, Kurtrus Ashfallen was no more. What remains now is something else.
VO_Story_Hero_Neeru_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Neeru_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7EmoteResponse_01	You will perish on this mountain.
VO_Story_Hero_Neeru_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7ExchangeA_01	You cannot have her, though – not unless you can get past me.
VO_Story_Hero_Neeru_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7ExchangeB_02	Ah, your sanctimonious companion…you look just like her, my dear.
VO_Story_Hero_Neeru_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7ExchangeC_02	<_Evil laugh_>
VO_Story_Hero_Neeru_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7ExchangeD_01	I will burn your mind.
VO_Story_Hero_Neeru_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7ExchangeE_01	YES! I relish this.
VO_Story_Hero_Neeru_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7HeroPower_01	Galtak Ered’nash!
VO_Story_Hero_Neeru_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7HeroPower_02	My madness makes me strong!
VO_Story_Hero_Neeru_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7HeroPower_03	All hail the Burning Blade!
VO_Story_Hero_Neeru_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7Idle_01	We will destroy the Horde AND the Alliance.
VO_Story_Hero_Neeru_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7Idle_02	You remind me of someone…someone I hate.
VO_Story_Hero_Neeru_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7Idle_03	You have the stink of Outland on you.
VO_Story_Hero_Neeru_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7Intro_02	Why, she’s right behind me, safe inside our den.
VO_Story_Hero_Neeru_Male_Orc_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7Loss_01	<_Insane laugh_>
VO_Story_Hero_Rathorian_Male_Demon_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Rathorian_Male_Demon_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5EmoteResponse_01	Enough of this. Destroy them!
VO_Story_Hero_Rathorian_Male_Demon_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeA_02	She is safe in our care, and none of your concern.
VO_Story_Hero_Rathorian_Male_Demon_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeB_Tavish_02	Oh, I’ll give you my sword, dwarf…straight through your midsection.
VO_Story_Hero_Rathorian_Male_Demon_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeC_01	Abandon the demon hunter and I will spare your life.
VO_Story_Hero_Rathorian_Male_Demon_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5HeroPower_01	Go forth.
VO_Story_Hero_Rathorian_Male_Demon_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5HeroPower_02	Demons, rise!
VO_Story_Hero_Rathorian_Male_Demon_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5HeroPower_03	Crush them!
VO_Story_Hero_Rathorian_Male_Demon_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5Idle_01	We are legion…Burning Legion.
VO_Story_Hero_Rathorian_Male_Demon_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5Idle_02	Are you afraid?
VO_Story_Hero_Rathorian_Male_Demon_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5Idle_03	You can’t kill us all.
VO_Story_Hero_Rathorian_Male_Demon_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5Intro_01	What excuse have you for occupying my sight?
VO_Story_Hero_Rathorian_Male_Demon_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5Loss_01	<_Maniacal laugh_>
VO_Story_Hero_Sangtusk_Female_Quilboar_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Sangtusk_Female_Quilboar_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3EmoteResponse_01	Your soul will fit nicely in my little pouch.
VO_Story_Hero_Sangtusk_Female_Quilboar_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3ExchangeA_01	I need more blood shards. More! <_snorts_>
VO_Story_Hero_Sangtusk_Female_Quilboar_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3ExchangeF_01	Thorns and quills.
VO_Story_Hero_Sangtusk_Female_Quilboar_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3ExchangeG_01	Souls…and blood.
VO_Story_Hero_Sangtusk_Female_Quilboar_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3HeroPower_01	<_Squeals_>
VO_Story_Hero_Sangtusk_Female_Quilboar_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3HeroPower_02	<_Snorts_>
VO_Story_Hero_Sangtusk_Female_Quilboar_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3HeroPower_03	For Agamaggan!
VO_Story_Hero_Sangtusk_Female_Quilboar_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3Idle_01	Agamaggan, give me power!
VO_Story_Hero_Sangtusk_Female_Quilboar_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3Idle_02	Agamaggan, grant me wisdom!
VO_Story_Hero_Sangtusk_Female_Quilboar_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3Idle_03	Agamaggan, give me courage!
VO_Story_Hero_Sangtusk_Female_Quilboar_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3Intro_02	Stop? No! I can’t…
VO_Story_Hero_Sangtusk_Female_Quilboar_Story_Kurtrus_Mission3Loss_01	And now you will be drained!
VO_Story_Hero_Sarilus_Male_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Sarilus_Male_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4EmoteResponse_01	This is not your fight, demon.
VO_Story_Hero_Sarilus_Male_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4HeroPower_01	My icy call.
VO_Story_Hero_Sarilus_Male_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4HeroPower_02	Frost walks.
VO_Story_Hero_Sarilus_Male_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4HeroPower_03	Make a splash.
VO_Story_Hero_Sarilus_Male_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4Idle_01	So many of you, and yet…no plan to defeat me.
VO_Story_Hero_Sarilus_Male_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4Idle_02	Why do adventurers always travel in packs of five?
VO_Story_Hero_Sarilus_Male_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4Idle_03	I’m adding you to the Shadow Council’s “list.”
VO_Story_Hero_Sarilus_Male_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4Intro_02	I will freeze the tide!
VO_Story_Hero_Sarilus_Male_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4Loss_01	I’m going to enjoy my new collection of ice sculptures.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4ExchangeB_02	Who told you that? It was Tavish, wasn’t it? I’ll wring that rotten dwarf’s –
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeB_Scabbs_01	The Burning Blade is enemies with Thrall’s Horde. Maybe we don’t need to fight these guys.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeB_Scabbs_02	Nah, I’m only kidding. Let’s cut them to pieces!
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeC_Scabbs_01	Sorry, boss. I got a mission to finish.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeD_Scabbs_01	Your knife skills ain’t too bad, neither.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeA_Scabbs_01	Wait a minute. I have intel on this rotten egg. Kazakus – he’s a potion maker outta Gadgetzan with a fledgling criminal syndicate.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeG_Scabbs_01	Gah! I’ll get you for that!
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeH_Scabbs_01	The bigger they are…the more I get to brag about smashing 'em.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeM_Scabbs_01	I don’t want to take you down – but that’s the way the biscuit breaks.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7Victory_01	Took you long enough to shut him up. I was beginning to get rather bored.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission7Victory_03	That’s right, Cariel – it’s Father’s favorite daughter…back from the dead.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8EmoteResponse_01	Ooh. I’m so scared.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeA_02	What happened? The Scourge happened. I served the Lich King until Lady Sylvanas liberated us.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeC_02	Of course not. I despise them. I was merely stealing their shard of naaru for my own ends.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeD_02	Oh, well, yes! What do you think I wanted their shard for?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeE_03	I AM dead!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeF_03	You always were a fool, Cariel.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeG_02	I could vanquish you with a snap of my fingers anytime. I just wanted to see who was going to win that fight.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeH_02	Eh…
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeJ_01	Oooh. Fancy weapon. Soooo impressive.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeK_01	This is the fight of your life, and your weapon of choice…is pigs?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeL_01	Aww, little demons! I see we’re not so different, you and I.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeM_01	So you like getting personal.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeN_01	It’s play time!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeO_01	Thank you for your service.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8ExchangeP_01	<_Over-the-top, evil laugh_>
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8HeroPower_01	Impeccable timing!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8HeroPower_02	Impudent demon hunter.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8HeroPower_03	I am the impresario of pain!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8HeroPower_04	Impressive!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8HeroPower_05	Implement my will!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8HeroPower_06	Me, lose? Impossible!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8HeroPower_07	Prepare for impact!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8HeroPower_08	I grow impatient!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8HeroPower_09	You imposter!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8HeroPower_10	Imp my ride!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8Idle_01	Ugch. Another sad-dad-on-a-mission story. How cliché.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8Idle_02	So…can you see through the blindfold?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8Idle_03	Sigh...
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8Idle_04	SIGH...
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8Idle_05	It may surprise you to learn that Cariel was the troublemaker in the family.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8Idle_06	Quit looking at me like that!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8Intro_01	Are you two going to fight over me? I’m honored.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8Loss_01	How tragic. You’ve come all this way for revenge, only to die. I’m…sorry. I love it so much!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Forsaken_Story_Kurtrus_Mission8Victory_02	Sorry, old man. I have places to be and demons to summon.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4ExchangeB_03	You’re inhalin’ too much mustache wax, Cutterbutter.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4ExchangeD_03	Aye, we’ll help, but I want a share of the loot!
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeB_Tavish_01	This is the demon leader? Ugly fellow, isn’t he? That sword will probably fetch a pretty copper though!
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeC_Tavish_01	Temptin’, but…NO!
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeD_Tavish_01	Don’t get all mushy on me. This is a purely transactional relationship.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeA_Tavish_01	You come waltzin’ into our camp and expect us to give ya our loot just because ya asked nicely? Ya got another thing comin’!
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeG_Tavish_01	What in the world was that?
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeH_Tavish_01	Time to take down the big one!
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeM_Tavish_01	You've got a funny way of showin’ it.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission4_03	Flank him, Cutterbutter, you tankard-sized scoundrel! Xyrella, cover me! I’m goin’ in.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6EmoteResponse_01	Yes, let’s talk things through.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeE_02	Come, Kazakus. Let this one go. She’s trying to save her daughter’s life.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeK_01	Kazakus, wait! Oh…shoot.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeL_01	Please, I have no quarrel with you.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeM_01	I don’t want to fight.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeN_01	I simply wish to investigate the shard’s power.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6HeroPower_01	I have an idea.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6HeroPower_02	There’s a good one.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6HeroPower_03	I just thought of something!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6Idle_01	My magic will chill you to the bone.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6Idle_02	I am the apprentice of Kael’thas Sunstrider, Prince of Quel’Thalas…so don’t mess with me!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6Idle_03	So…uh…know any good jokes?
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6Loss_01	For the last time, leave me alone!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission6_02	Kazakus, I sense these travelers have it in their possession.
VO_Story_Hero_Wife_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission1_01	Elune-adore…
VO_Story_Hero_Wife_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission1_02	Ande'thoras-ethil…
VO_Story_Hero_Wife_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission1_03	Sha'ha lor'ma…
VO_Story_Hero_Wife_Female_NightElf_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission1_06	Wake up, Kurtrus. Wake up!
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4ExchangeA_01	Thank you for coming to our aid. I am Xyrella, and this is Tavish and Scabbs. Do you also seek the shard of naaru on Dreadmist Peak?
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4ExchangeC_01	The naaru fractured in the sky, raining shards of Light across the land.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4ExchangeC_02	We heard a rumor that the Cult of the Burning Blade found a shard and is using it as part of a demonic ritual.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Kurtrus_Mission4ExchangeD_02	It would be my honor, friend.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeB_Xyrella_01	Stay strong, my friend. We will face this evil together.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeB_Xyrella_03	Because I know we will persevere.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeC_Xyrella_01	Our fight is the same. Get out of our way.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Kurtrus_Mission5ExchangeD_Xyrella_01	It is good to have a healer when you find yourself in constant danger.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeA_Xyrella_01	Please, Kurtrus, do not let him take the shard.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeB_02	No. I will not part with it.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeD_02	My daughter’s life is in peril. She needs the shard. You cannot have it.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeG_Xyrella_01	Kurtrus! Are you all right?
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeH_Xyrella_01	Look at the size of that thing!
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6ExchangeM_Xyrella_01	Then go.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Kurtrus_Mission6Victory_02	Yes, and the shard is safe.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_Story_Kurtrus_PreMission5_02	I share your grief. We must stop the warlock and get the shard, saving my heart and bringing peace to your own.

VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission1_01	If you come in search of heroes, you will find none here. Unlike those spineless cowards, I shall tell you the truth about what happened—all the glory and all of the darkness.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission1_02	For even in the beginning, there was darkness. It clawed away at the corners of my life until nothing else remained.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1Intro_02	Get it over with.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1ExchangeB_01	I cannot win against him. At best, I can endure.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1ExchangeC_02	I don't have anything to give.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1ExchangeD_01	You know as well as I… There is nowhere I can go.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Threaten_01	I will not forget this moment.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Concede_01	It has only begun.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Threaten_02	I revel in the slaughter!
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Thanks_01	You have been useful.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Attack_01	I am your nightmare.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Well_Played_01	I see your strength…
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Wow_01	Inspiring…
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Greetings_01	Mine is the only way.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Oops_01	That was in error.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_NoCards_01	I will not be denied!
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Error_Generic_01	No.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_LowCards_01	What is this?

VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission2_01	I was no stranger to suffering. Since my youth, I was burdened with the misplaced cruelty of my people.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission2_02	But months of deprivation brought me to the brink of death. Only then did I accept that I needed the safety of a clan.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission2_03	As the old shaman's words rang through my mind, I used the last of my strength to reach the Throne of the Elements.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission2Intro_01	Spirits of the natural world! I… offer myself… to your service.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission2ExchangeA_01	I come before you humbled… and broken… lend me your power that I may live.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission2ExchangeB_01	End my anguish… I beg you!
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission2ExchangeC_01	What is this?! You deny me?
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission2ExchangeC_02	Aaaaaaaaaagh!
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission2ExchangeC_05	I… will do anything. 
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission2ExchangeD_01	I was true to my word. And in return, he gave me what he had promised… 
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission2ExchangeE_02	My people? I have no people!
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission2Victory_01	Thank you, shaman. I found my destiny.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission2Victory_02	Never again will I grovel before the world. Instead, the world will grovel before me!
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission3_01	My dark master had many plans. At his bidding, I corrupted the Throne of the Elements and spread a pox across the land.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission3_02	The orcs grew desperate and easy to manipulate. Hiding my true power, I sought out the shaman of the esteemed Shadowmoon Clan.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3Intro_02	Word has spread of your power, Chieftain. I wish to witness it.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3ExchangeA_02	Alas, it was destroyed… by ogres.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3ExchangeB_02	No. It has proven… difficult.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3ExchangeC_02	Perhaps they lack your wisdom, great chieftain.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3ExchangeD_02	Do you?
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3ExchangeD_04	Ah, yes. The grief is indeed a burden.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3ExchangeE_01	You have excellent shaman here.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3ExchangeE_03	How interesting.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3ExchangeF_01	If I have at all impressed you, allow me to learn more.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3ExchangeF_03	We have both lost much. And the orcs stand to lose even more with the elements in chaos and the red pox spreading.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission4_01	The master twisted Ner'zhul's grief to serve his own ends, driving him to unite the orcs in war against the peaceful draenei.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission4_02	We became the Horde—an unstoppable army led by Warchief Blackhand. One by one, we devastated the settlements of our foes.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission4_03	By the time Ner'zhul suspected anything, my favor with master Kil'jaeden had greatly eclipsed his own. He was helpless to stop me.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Intro_01	Chieftains of the Horde! This is the Cup of Unity. I offer its blessings to all who pledge their loyalty to our cause.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Intro_02	Who will be the first to come forth?
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4ExchangeA_01	Drink, Hellscream. Claim your destiny. You will all be conquerors.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4ExchangeD_01	Mighty Durotan, come forth and join the other chieftains!
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4ExchangeD_03	You defy me openly? What if your warriors disagree?
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4ExchangeE_01	What is it you know?
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4ExchangeE_03	There will be consequences for your actions, Frostwolf.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Victory_01	Durotan has made his choice. All who have wished to receive the blessing have done so.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Threaten_01	Heed my words or regret it.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Entice_01	Do you not crave power?
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Plead_01	Listen to me… please.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission5_01	Few of them knew what they had drunk. It was the blood of a demon lord, Mannoroth, and its curse empowered them to conquer the draenei and scar the face of our world.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission5_02	I had forged the orcs into a weapon for Kil'jaeden. And then… he abandoned us. I waited for a sign of what was to come…
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission5Intro_02	What is this vision? Show yourself!
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission5ExchangeA_02	Sargeras?
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission5ExchangeB_02	What is asked of me in return?
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission5ExchangeC_02	I have been promised that before.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission5ExchangeD_02	You know our world is broken, and our warriors hunger. Yours is an offer that I cannot refuse.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission5Victory_02	Tell me what I must do.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission6_01	Fueled by sacrifice, the Dark Portal opened... and our invasion of Azeroth began. I remained close to Medivh until his death shattered the connection between our minds.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission6_02	While I was incapacitated, Orgrim Doomhammer defeated the warchief in a Mak'gora, and became the new leader of the Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission6_03	All of the power I had, everything I had built… vanished overnight.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6Intro_02	I don't know what you mean.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6ExchangeA_02	What did you say…
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6ExchangeB_02	Where are they?
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6ExchangeC_03	He should not have spoken against me.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6Victory_01	Wait! Please, I beg you!
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6Victory_03	You need me. You need warriors who are loyal to you alone… only I can create them.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission7_01	I would not be defeated by Doomhammer's petty threats. Among the warlocks he struck down was Teron'gor of the Shadowmoon clan...
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission7_02	It seemed a shame to lose one of my oldest allies, so I searched for a way to revive him.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission7Intro_01	We cannot abandon the souls of our fallen warriors. Use the human corpses to grant them new life!
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission7ExchangeA_01	I must find a way…
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission7ExchangeB_01	Why is this taking so long?! 
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission7ExchangeC_01	Ah, I see. We need more power…
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission7ExchangeD_01	Do not despair. You shall serve a new, greater purpose.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission7ExchangeE_01	Return to this world… serve the Horde once more.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission7Victory_02	Behold the first death knight.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission8_01	Impressed by my creations, Orgrim wasted no time in going to war. This was the distraction I had been waiting for.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PreMission8_02	When Medivh passed, I had seen deeply into his mind, revealing the location of the Tomb of Sargeras. Now I was finally free to pursue the promise of godhood…
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission8Intro_01	Follow me, warriors! Obtain the Eye of Sargeras before the Tomb Guardian awakens!
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission8ExchangeA_01	Spineless cowards! We press on!
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission8ExchangeB_01	This tomb has been sealed since Medivh's mother, Aegwynn, defeated Sargeras… Untold power awaits us here.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission8ExchangeC_02	The Eye of Sargeras will give me the power to control this world. 
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission8ExchangeC_03	No more scheming, no more warchiefs, no more armies… Just my sovereign, unbreakable might!
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission8ExchangeD_01	This artifact was promised to me. Why does the guardian fight us?
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission8Victory_02	Curse you! Again, I am betrayed… all that has passed, and I am nothing more than your pawn.
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PostMission8_01	As I said, there are no heroes here. But in the end, my name yet lives on… a wild, flickering flame that illuminates what hides in the shadows… 
VO_Story_Hero_Guldan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_PostMission8_02	…the awful truths that your heroes will never let you see. For even in death, I will not be denied!
	
VO_Story_Hero_ForgottenWarrior_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1Intro_01	Long have you refused your place in this clan. Now we rid ourselves of your filth once and for all.
VO_Story_Hero_ForgottenWarrior_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1ExchangeA_01	Fool! Even now, you test me.
VO_Story_Hero_ForgottenWarrior_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1ExchangeC_01	You eat our food and shelter under our roof. Yet you give nothing in return! 
VO_Story_Hero_ForgottenWarrior_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1Victory_03	You are cast out. In the wastes, you will understand what it means to have no people.
VO_Story_Hero_ForgottenWarrior_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1Death_01	<_death exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_ForgottenWarrior_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1EmoteResponse_01	Is that how you beg for mercy?
VO_Story_Hero_ForgottenWarrior_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1HeroPower_01	Pathetic wretch!
VO_Story_Hero_ForgottenWarrior_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1HeroPower_02	Begone!
VO_Story_Hero_ForgottenWarrior_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1HeroPower_03	No one wants you here!
VO_Story_Hero_ForgottenWarrior_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1Loss_01	We should have left you behind long ago.
VO_Story_Hero_ForgottenWarrior_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1Idle_01	Your own kin have turned against you.
VO_Story_Hero_ForgottenWarrior_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1Idle_02	There is no future for you here.
VO_Story_Hero_ForgottenWarrior_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1Idle_03	Our clan lives or dies based on who is the weakest. And I will not die for you.
VO_Story_Hero_ForgottenWarrior_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission2ExchangeE_01	How dare you return here! You may never rejoin your people.
	
VO_Story_Minion_ForgottenShaman_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1ExchangeE_01	Gul'dan, there is nothing more I can do for you. But know I have always believed there is greatness within you.
VO_Story_Minion_ForgottenShaman_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1Victory_01	Enough! I have tried to help him find his place among us. I failed.
VO_Story_Minion_ForgottenShaman_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission1Victory_02	Seek out the Throne of the Elements, perhaps there you will find your destiny.

VO_Story_Hero_ThroneofElements_Elemental_Story_Guldan_Mission2Death	<_crumbling noise_>

VO_Story_Minion_Kiljaeden_Male_Demon_Story_Guldan_Mission2ExchangeC_03	Gul'dan... 
VO_Story_Minion_Kiljaeden_Male_Demon_Story_Guldan_Mission2ExchangeC_04	I can grant you what you seek. And punish those who wronged you… in return for your service.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Nerzhul_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3Intro_01	What brings you here, stranger?
VO_Story_Hero_Nerzhul_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3Intro_03	Very well.
VO_Story_Hero_Nerzhul_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3ExchangeA_01	What clan do you hail from?
VO_Story_Hero_Nerzhul_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3ExchangeB_01	I am sorry for your loss. You have not been accepted by another clan?
VO_Story_Hero_Nerzhul_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3ExchangeC_01	You could be an impressive shaman. Why has no one seen that?
VO_Story_Hero_Nerzhul_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3ExchangeD_01	I know the pain you must feel…
VO_Story_Hero_Nerzhul_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3ExchangeD_03	I lost my beloved Rulkan. Every day I miss her.
VO_Story_Hero_Nerzhul_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3ExchangeE_02	Yes, Teron'gor is among our finest.
VO_Story_Hero_Nerzhul_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3Victory_02	The Shadowmoon Clan is slow to trust outsiders, and yet…
VO_Story_Hero_Nerzhul_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3Victory_04	These are trying times, Gul'dan. You may stay.
VO_Story_Hero_Nerzhul_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3EmoteResponse_01	You are an interesting one.
VO_Story_Hero_Nerzhul_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3HeroPower_01	Elements, answer me!
VO_Story_Hero_Nerzhul_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3HeroPower_02	Glory to Shadowmoon!
VO_Story_Hero_Nerzhul_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3HeroPower_03	Spirits of nature, bend to my will!
VO_Story_Hero_Nerzhul_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3Loss_01	Outsiders like you are a rare sight in these lands. Few last long on their own.
VO_Story_Hero_Nerzhul_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3Idle_01	The Shadowmoon Clan is revered by all, and I mean to keep that legacy.
VO_Story_Hero_Nerzhul_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3Idle_02	Thanks to the red pox, many clans have sent their sick warriors to a village to recover.
VO_Story_Hero_Nerzhul_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission3Idle_03	The ancestors have been so quiet of late. It worries me.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Intro_03	I will.
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4EmoteResponse_01	Do not delay, Gul'dan. I thirst.
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Loss_01	I see now… Your blessing is not what was promised!
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Idle_01	My patience grows thin.
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Idle_02	The Warsong clan will prove its strength to all.
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Idle_03	I must taste this endless power… I will have it for my own!
VO_Story_Hero_Grommash_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Enrage	AAAAAAAAAAAH!!

VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4ExchangeB_01	I will be the next to taste this honor!
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4ExchangeB_02	<_enraged growl_>
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4ExchangeC_01	And you, Orgrim. Accompany me!
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4EmoteResponse_01	What are you trying to say?
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Loss_01	This is a WAR, Gul'dan. There is no room for failure.
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Idle_01	Grommash should've let ME drink first. I am his Warchief…
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Idle_02	You will have my favor so long as you continue to be useful, Gul'dan.
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Idle_03	We cannot rest as long as the draenei still live.
VO_Story_Hero_Blackhand_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Victory_02	Tonight we make history. Tonight we crush our enemies and grind their last stronghold into dust. FOR THE HORDE!
	
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4ExchangeC_02	I could not take that glory from you.
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6Intro_01	So you are awake. I know what you have done, Gul'dan… how you controlled Blackhand with your treachery and lies!
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6ExchangeA_01	Silence! I did not say you could speak! Even now, you test me.
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6ExchangeB_01	I rule the Horde now, not you. Not your warlocks.
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6ExchangeB_03	Dead. I killed most of them.
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6ExchangeC_01	Because of you, Blackhand exiled Durotan and the Frostwolf clan!
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6ExchangeC_02	But you were not content with that. You sent assassins to kill his family. They will be avenged!
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6Victory_02	Pathetic wretch… why should I listen to a single word you say?!
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6Victory_04	Very well. I will hold you to that. Stray even slightly, and you will die.
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission7EmoteResponse_01	I said SILENCE!
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6HeroPower_01	No more deceit!
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6HeroPower_02	Your corruption must end!
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6HeroPower_03	Vengeance!
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6Loss_01	The mighty Gul'dan has fallen. Durotan may rest easy now.
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6Idle_01	Blackhand was your puppet and no one cared to see it. But I always knew.
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6Idle_02	I never trusted you. Have you forgotten that I did not drink from your vile cup?
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission6Idle_03	Durotan knew the truth… you poisoned our people, our world. If only we had listened.
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission7Victory_01	Well, have you succeeded? 
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission7Victory_04	Teron'gor? But I killed you myself…
VO_Story_Minion_Orgrim_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission7Victory_06	So it would seem…
	
VO_Story_Hero_Durotan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4ExchangeD_01	I will not.
VO_Story_Hero_Durotan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4ExchangeD_03	The Frostwolf clan stands behind me.
VO_Story_Hero_Durotan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4ExchangeE_02	Enough to forsake your "gift."
VO_Story_Hero_Durotan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4EmoteResponse_01	You cannot persuade me.
VO_Story_Hero_Durotan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Loss_01	Trust me, this is for the best. I will undo all you have wrought.
VO_Story_Hero_Durotan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Idle_01	You have forgotten about Ner'zhul, but he has not forgotten you. And he has much to say.
VO_Story_Hero_Durotan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Idle_02	Blackhand is too hungry for battle. He cannot see your lies for what they are.
VO_Story_Hero_Durotan_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Idle_03	I have met the leader of the draenei, Velen. He is nothing like what you have said!

VO_Story_Minion_Fenris_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Drink_01	Very well. I shall drink.
VO_Story_Minion_Fenris_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4HeroPower_03	Howl for mercy.
VO_Story_Minion_Fenris_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Idle_01	I have heard whispers of your schemes warlock.
VO_Story_Minion_Fenris_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Idle_02	Do not try the patience of the Thunderlord clan.
VO_Story_Minion_Fenris_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Idle_03	We chieftans are very different. You will not easily unite us.
VO_Story_Minion_Fenris_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission4Loss_01	You were always weak.

VO_Story_Minion_Hurkan_Male_Orc_Drink_01	I too will taste this honor.
VO_Story_Minion_Hurkan_Male_Orc_HeroPower_01	Hunger devours all.
VO_Story_Minion_Hurkan_Male_Orc_Idle_01	Some will feed and others will starve. That is the way of it.
VO_Story_Minion_Hurkan_Male_Orc_Idle_02	You achieved much in so little time, stranger…
VO_Story_Minion_Hurkan_Male_Orc_Idle_03	Our enemies are out there… waiting to be vanquished.
VO_Story_Minion_Hurkan_Male_Orc_Loss_01	Ahahaha!

VO_Story_Minion_Kargath_Male_Orc_Attack_01	I am unstoppable!
VO_Story_Minion_Kargath_Male_Orc_EmoteResponse_01	What's that?
VO_Story_Minion_Kargath_Male_Orc_Idle_01	We follow power. Nothing else.
VO_Story_Minion_Kargath_Male_Orc_Idle_02	Blackhand will lead us to glory, or death.
VO_Story_Minion_Kargath_Male_Orc_Idle_03	Embrace pain. Use it. Then no one can stand against you.
VO_Story_Minion_Kargath_Male_Orc_Loss_01	<_dismissive sneer_>
VO_Story_Minion_Kargath_Male_Orc_Play_01	Shattered hands can still strike!
			
VO_Story_Minion_Kilrogg_Male_Orc_Drink_01	Give me the cup.
VO_Story_Minion_Kilrogg_Male_Orc_HeroPower_03	Power always wins.
VO_Story_Minion_Kilrogg_Male_Orc_Idle_01	Your offer is intriguing, but I would know more.
VO_Story_Minion_Kilrogg_Male_Orc_Idle_02	We cannot afford to make mistakes against the draenei.
VO_Story_Minion_Kilrogg_Male_Orc_Idle_03	Blackhand decides only for himself, not the rest of us.
VO_Story_Minion_Kilrogg_Male_Orc_Loss_01	A shame… you may have been onto something.
 
VO_Story_Minion_Zuluhed_Male_Orc_Drink_01	Hm… I shall try a drink.
VO_Story_Minion_Zuluhed_Male_Orc_HeroPower_01	Prove yourself to us!
VO_Story_Minion_Zuluhed_Male_Orc_Idle_01	The ancestors never spoke of this. Would they approve?
VO_Story_Minion_Zuluhed_Male_Orc_Idle_02	Your words will reveal you—one way or another.
VO_Story_Minion_Zuluhed_Male_Orc_Idle_03	Only a fool would lie to all the chieftains.
VO_Story_Minion_Zuluhed_Male_Orc_Loss_01	What a waste of time.
VO_Story_Minion_Zuluhed_Male_Orc_Story_Group_FTH	FOR THE HORDE!
VO_Story_Minion_Zuluhed_Male_Orc_Attack_01	Face the Dragonmaw!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Medivh_Male_Human_Story_Guldan_Mission5Intro_01	Kil'jaeden promised you power, but left you adrift and alone…
VO_Story_Hero_Medivh_Male_Human_Story_Guldan_Mission5ExchangeA_01	I come to remedy his wrongs… by order of his master.
VO_Story_Hero_Medivh_Male_Human_Story_Guldan_Mission5ExchangeA_03	Yes, the one who rules over all.
VO_Story_Hero_Medivh_Male_Human_Story_Guldan_Mission5ExchangeB_01	Your people are dying. Bring them to a fresh, unspoiled world with new enemies to conquer.
VO_Story_Hero_Medivh_Male_Human_Story_Guldan_Mission5ExchangeC_01	Sargeras's body lies imprisoned in an ancient tomb. Help him escape, and you shall have the power of a god.
VO_Story_Hero_Medivh_Male_Human_Story_Guldan_Mission5ExchangeD_01	I offer you power beyond imagining…
VO_Story_Hero_Medivh_Male_Human_Story_Guldan_Mission5Victory_01	I see now how useful you shall be.
VO_Story_Hero_Medivh_Male_Human_Story_Guldan_Mission5Victory_03	Together we will build a portal the likes of which our worlds have never seen!
VO_Story_Hero_Medivh_Male_Human_Story_Guldan_Mission5EmoteResponse_01	I only wish to aid you.
VO_Story_Hero_Medivh_Male_Human_Story_Guldan_Mission5HeroPower_01	Sargeras's power is limitless…
VO_Story_Hero_Medivh_Male_Human_Story_Guldan_Mission5HeroPower_02	This strength could be yours!
VO_Story_Hero_Medivh_Male_Human_Story_Guldan_Mission5HeroPower_03	Isn't this what you aspire to?
VO_Story_Hero_Medivh_Male_Human_Story_Guldan_Mission5Loss_01	You were capable of so much more than this.
VO_Story_Hero_Medivh_Male_Human_Story_Guldan_Mission5Idle_01	Only an army like yours could serve Sargeras well.
VO_Story_Hero_Medivh_Male_Human_Story_Guldan_Mission5Idle_02	My new world is verdant and lush. Yours is dying. What choice do you have?
VO_Story_Hero_Medivh_Male_Human_Story_Guldan_Mission5Idle_03	It will take some… effort to bridge our realms. But I have the utmost faith in you.
	
VO_Story_Minion_Necrolyte_Male_Orc_Story_Guldan_Mission7Intro_02	As you command.
	
VO_Story_Hero_TeronGorefiend_Male_Undead_Story_Guldan_Mission7ExchangeE_02	Gul'dan… You have brought me back.
VO_Story_Hero_TeronGorefiend_Male_Undead_Story_Guldan_Mission7Victory_03	Doomhammer…
VO_Story_Hero_TeronGorefiend_Male_Undead_Story_Guldan_Mission7Victory_05	Death is no end with the magic of Gul'dan.
VO_Story_Hero_TeronGorefiend_Male_Undead_Story_Guldan_Mission7EmoteResponse_01	<_faint rasp_>
VO_Story_Hero_TeronGorefiend_Male_Undead_Story_Guldan_Mission7HeroPower_01	<_ghostly growl_>
VO_Story_Hero_TeronGorefiend_Male_Undead_Story_Guldan_Mission7HeroPower_02	<_ghostly growl_>
VO_Story_Hero_TeronGorefiend_Male_Undead_Story_Guldan_Mission7HeroPower_03	<_eerie sigh_>
VO_Story_Hero_TeronGorefiend_Male_Undead_Story_Guldan_Mission7Loss_01	<_raspy snarl_>
	
VO_Story_Minion_ChoGall_Male_Ogre_Story_Guldan_Mission8Intro_02	Guardians? You said nothing of guardians!
VO_Story_Minion_ChoGall_Male_Ogre_Story_Guldan_Mission8ExchangeC_01	What is it you seek, master?
VO_Story_Minion_ChoGall_Male_Ogre_Story_Guldan_Mission8ExchangeD_02	Perhaps… the demons lied?
	
VO_Story_Hero_TombGuardian_Male_Demon_Story_Guldan_Mission8Intro_03	Turn back mortal!
VO_Story_Hero_TombGuardian_Male_Demon_Story_Guldan_Mission8EmoteResponse_01	<_demonic snarl_>
VO_Story_Hero_TombGuardian_Male_Demon_Story_Guldan_Mission8Idle_01	None may defile the tomb.
VO_Story_Hero_TombGuardian_Male_Demon_Story_Guldan_Mission8Idle_02	Obey the master or suffer his wrath.
VO_Story_Hero_TombGuardian_Male_Demon_Story_Guldan_Mission8Idle_03	There is only death within these walls.
VO_Story_Hero_TombGuardian_Male_Demon_Story_Guldan_Mission8Loss_01	Sargeras brought you here to have a taste of power before the end… You deserved as much.
VO_Story_Hero_TombGuardian_Male_Demon_Story_Guldan_Mission8Death_01	Aaagh!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Sargeras_Male_Demon_Story_Guldan_Mission8Victory_01	Ahahahaha...
VO_Story_Hero_Sargeras_Male_Demon_Story_Guldan_Mission8Victory_03	You were a fool to ever believe. Yet so many suffered and died for your fleeting, dark dream.
VO_Story_Hero_Sargeras_Male_Demon_Story_Guldan_Mission8Victory_04	Gul'dan...

VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission1_01	Perhaps you have heard of my fate… I defended my people from a demonic invasion, only to be imprisoned for ten thousand years.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission1_02	But my story does not end there. It was Tyrande who freed me, pleading for my help. My heart leapt at the sound of her voice…
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission1_03	However, my brother, my own flesh and blood, still shunned me as a villain.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission1Intro_01	I'll show them all! Demons have no power over me. I repelled them once, I will do so again.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission1ExchangeA_01	You'll regret approaching me.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission1ExchangeB_01	You reek of death.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission1ExchangeC_01	Corruption lingers in these forests…
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission1ExchangeD_01	You only say this to tempt me to steal it… But why?
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission1Victory_01	We could go on fighting like this forever. Still, I have no reason to believe you.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission2_01	Though I did not trust the stranger for even a second, the memory of that cold, dark cell was fresh in my mind.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission2_02	I needed a guarantee that I would never return to that silent hell. Therefore, I pursued Tichondrius…
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2Intro_01	Demons. Always so quick to underestimate me…
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2ExchangeA_02	So this is where the Skull of Gul'dan is kept… I will claim it!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2ExchangeB_02	It may surprise you that the landscaping is not my primary concern.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2ExchangeC_01	Why do you think they released me?
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2ExchangeD_01	You have more enemies than you realize. One of your own sent me here.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2ExchangeE_01	Yes… this shall be mine!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2ExchangeE_02	Now I am complete!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2ExchangeE_04	Let's see how confident you are against one of your own kind, dreadlord!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2Victory_02	Do you not recognize me? I destroyed the leader of the undead. Your forests will heal.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2Victory_04	So be it.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission3_01	My banishment forced me to make new allies. The demon lord Kil'jaeden offered me a chance of redemption with the Burning Legion. All I had to do was kill his errant servant, the Lich King.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission3_02	I gratefully accepted. Having betrayed the demons before, I knew I could do it again. But all the while, I was ruthlessly hunted by wardens.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission3Intro_01	So you've made it at last. I knew you would.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission3ExchangeA_01	Naivete does not suit you. Surely you know why I have come to this place…
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission3ExchangeA_03	Yes, though I'll settle for one small piece. The Eye alone is enough to destroy my enemies.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission3ExchangeB_02	I often succeed where others failed.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission3ExchangeC_02	You could never measure up to her, warden.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission3ExchangeD_02	You cannot comprehend what I am truly after.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission3Victory_02	Isolation can do that. After all the long centuries you kept me chained in darkness, it is only fitting I bury you in turn.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission4_01	Somehow, Maiev survived and rallied the elves against me, just as I was readying to use the Eye of Sargeras against the Lich King.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission4_02	I could have destroyed him… I had the power… but instead, I faced more accusations.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4Intro_01	No! The spell is not done!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4ExchangeA_01	Stand down! The spellwork is too fragile!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4ExchangeB_01	You can't do this!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4ExchangeC_01	Can you not see? I was going to strike the undead—our common enemy!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4ExchangeC_03	What?
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4ExchangeC_06	You know I would never see her come to harm. Let me help look for her.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4ExchangeD_02	I swear on my life that I will bring her back, my brother.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4ExchangeE_02	No, Tyrande. You must believe me. I've come to save you!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4Victory_02	Whatever I may be—whatever I may become in this world, know that I will always look out for you, Tyrande.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission5_01	At last, our rivalry was settled. But I knew Kil'jaeden would be quick to punish me for my failure to eliminate the Lich King.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission5_02	I needed to go somewhere beyond his grasp… Outland, the homeworld of the orcs, would serve nicely.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission5_03	But first, I had to expel the remaining demons!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission5Intro_02	Indeed, but your victory will be! The hour of wrath has come!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission5ExchangeA_02	We'll see about that.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission5ExchangeB_02	Your people shall have their vengeance, Akama.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission5ExchangeC_01	Well done, Lady Vashj. I knew the naga could be counted on.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission5ExchangeD_02	You strike valiantly, Kael'thas. Would that my own people were so reliable.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission5ExchangeE_01	This citadel was once the temple of your people, Akama. I will purge the demons from it!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission5Victory_02	I have come to replace you.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission5Victory_03	From this moment on, Outland and all of its denizens will bow to ME!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission6_01	The thrill of victory was short-lived. Kil'jaeden caught up with me and demanded to know why I had been growing my forces.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission6_02	I had to quickly fabricate a tale that I had built the army to defeat the Lich King for him. Being a fool, he bought it.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission6_03	I left Outland under Akama's watch, and returned to Azeroth, journeying far to the frozen north…
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission6Intro_01	Hello again, Arthas.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission6ExchangeA_02	Arthas is keeping strange company these days.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission6ExchangeB_02	Well, I can certainly understand his desperate need for allies.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission6ExchangeC_01	You're out of your league, old king. You should have stayed hidden underground.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission6ExchangeD_01	I have power of my own. I nearly destroyed the Lich King before, and now I shall finish the task! 
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission6ExchangeD_03	What is that?
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission6Victory_02	Let us finish what we started!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission7_01	In a way, I felt for Arthas. The Lich King had manipulated him the same way Kil'jaeden tried to toy with me. But he was not clever enough to resist.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission7_02	I had spent my whole life questioning everything and trusting no one. Surely that wretched boy could not have measured up to me…
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission7Intro_01	The hour has come at last. After today, the Scourge will meet its end.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission7ExchangeA_02	I'd like to see you try.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission7ExchangeB_02	I know.
VO_EX1_614_Male_NightElf_HunterPrince_Start2Response_01	I have sworn to destroy it, Arthas. It must be done!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_IllidanMission7Obelisk_01	If I take more obelisks, Arthas is trapped.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_IllidanMission7Obelisk_02	Got one.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_IllidanMission7Obelisk_03	There's another.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission7Victory_04	Agh!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission8_01	Arthas became the new Lich King, absorbing power even I could not surpass. I returned to Outland, taking up residence in the Black Temple.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PreMission8_02	I expected Kil'jaeden to again confront me, and I raised a brutal army to meet him. Perhaps… I went a little too far in the eyes of my former allies.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission8Intro_01	Akama! Your duplicity is hardly surprising.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission8Intro_02	I should have slaughtered you and your malformed brethren long ago.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission8ExchangeA_01	Boldly said. But I remain… unconvinced.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission8ExchangeB_02	I will not be touched by rabble such as you!
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission8ExchangeC_02	You are calling me the Betrayer? That's rich.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission8ExchangeD_01	Is this it, Akama? Is this all the fury you can muster?
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission8ExchangeE_01	Maiev… How is it even possible? I defeated you long ago.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission8Victory_02	You have won… but the huntress is nothing without the hunt. You are nothing without me.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PostMission8_01	I believed it was over… that my long and miserable journey had met a swift and vengeful end.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PostMission8_02	But no. As often as I have been misunderstood, so did I misunderstand the number of chances I would get… the endless hidden tricks of fate.
VO_Story_Hero_Illidan_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_PostMission8_03	I did my best to play them well, to overcome my many flaws, and to remember… there is always more to the story.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission1Intro_02	Are you certain your will is truly your own?
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission1ExchangeA_02	I think you'll find that we're evenly matched.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission1ExchangeB_02	Ahahaha...
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission1ExchangeC_02	It is the work of Tichondrius. He bears an artifact of tremendous power, the Skull of Gul'dan.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission1ExchangeD_02	The lord I serve would… benefit from your assistance.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission1Victory_02	My master has seen all. He knows the power you've sought your whole life. Seize it, and your enemies will be undone.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission1EmoteResponse_01	Fine words, demon hunter.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission1HeroPower_01	You've never seen a blade like this!
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission1HeroPower_02	Strike for strike!
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission1HeroPower_03	Death is the greatest power.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission1Loss_01	You will have to do better than that to face the Legion, night elf.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission1Idle_01	Everything you want is nearly within your grasp… Yet you hesitate.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission1Idle_02	The darkness within me goes deeper than you could ever fathom.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission1Idle_03	Demons march on your lands. Will you be a victim or a victor?
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission6Intro_02	You look different, Illidan. I guess the Skull of Gul'dan didn't agree with you.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission6Intro_03	Anub'arak! See that my work is not disturbed.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission6Victory_01	Time's running out! I will deal with him myself.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission7Intro_02	This is no end, but a new beginning.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission7ExchangeA_01	You have mocked the Scourge long enough! I will put the fear of death back in you.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_IllidanMission7Obelisk_04	You cannot break my control.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission7ExchangeC_01	Ah, Kael'thas. Are you still upset that Jaina loved me and not you?
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission7Victory_01	The Frozen Throne awaits me. Step aside, demon!
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission7EmoteResponse_01	The hour grows late, demon.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission7HeroPower_01	There is no defeating the dead.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission7HeroPower_02	You chose the wrong side.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission7HeroPower_03	How much will you sacrifice?
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission7Loss_01	You were a match for me once, but that time is over.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission7Idle_01	I have claimed many lives greater than yours. Like my own father's.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission7Idle_02	I must say, you did fine work disposing of Tichondrius. You ought to follow my orders more often.
VO_Story_Hero_Arthas_Male_Human_Story_Illidan_Mission7Idle_03	Day and night my mind is racked with visions of the Frozen Throne. Its call fills my every thought.
VO_TB_PrinceHunter_ArthasH_Male_Human_HunterPrince_Start2_01	Leave this world and never return. If you do, I’ll be waiting.
VO_TB_PrinceHunter_ArthasH_Male_Human_HunterPrince_Start3_01	Never!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Tichondrius_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2Intro_01	Come no further, weakling!
VO_Story_Hero_Tichondrius_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2ExchangeB_01	It is too late to defend your little forests. This corruption will linger eternally.
VO_Story_Hero_Tichondrius_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2ExchangeC_01	Strange… the other elves fell so easily before us.
VO_Story_Hero_Tichondrius_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2ExchangeD_02	Hah. I find that unlikely.
VO_Story_Hero_Tichondrius_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2ExchangeE_02	What? Who are… you?
VO_Story_Hero_Tichondrius_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2Death_01	Agh!
VO_Story_Hero_Tichondrius_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	Very subtle.
VO_Story_Hero_Tichondrius_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2HeroPower_01	Face the swarm!
VO_Story_Hero_Tichondrius_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2HeroPower_02	Insufferable mortal!
VO_Story_Hero_Tichondrius_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2HeroPower_03	Go forth and feast!
VO_Story_Hero_Tichondrius_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2Loss_01	When will you learn not to trifle with the nathrezim?
VO_Story_Hero_Tichondrius_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2Idle_01	This skull was rescued from a tomb only to fall into the hands of demons yet again… 
VO_Story_Hero_Tichondrius_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2Idle_02	You have never heard of Gul'dan, but we invested a great deal of power in him. And much of it remains.
VO_Story_Hero_Tichondrius_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2Idle_03	The Burning Legion has glorious plans for your world. We will finish what we started ten thousand years ago.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2Victory_01	Foul demon! What have you done with my brother?
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2Victory_03	At the cost of your soul? Begone from this place. Never set foot in our lands again!
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4Intro_02	It is over, brother.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4ExchangeC_02	Your vile schemes end here. Because of you, Tyrande is dead!
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4ExchangeD_01	I risk much by trusting you, Illidan.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4Victory_03	We have had much strife between us, but, for my part, I wish it to end. From this day forward, let there be peace between us, Illidan.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4EmoteResponse_01	I am so disappointed in you.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4HeroPower_01	Nature will heal.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4HeroPower_02	Grow stronger!
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4HeroPower_03	Mend your wounds.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4Loss_01	Imprisonment will not be enough this time.
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4Idle_01	You are a monster now. How can you even look at yourself?
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4Idle_02	These spells will shatter our world!
VO_Story_Hero_Malfurion_Male_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4Idle_03	I still do not understand why it had to come to this.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4ExchangeE_01	Illidan! What trickery is this? Have you come to finish me off personally?
VO_Story_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4Victory_01	You… risked your life for me. I don't understand.
VO_Story_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4ExchangeE_03	Save me?
VO_Story_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4ExchangeF_01	Fight on my warriors, we must hold onto hope.
VO_Story_Hero_Tyrande_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4ExchangeG_01	We've got to keep fighting. It cannot end this way.

VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission3Intro_02	You have much to pay for, Illidan. I'm taking you back to your cell!
VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission3ExchangeA_02	You are obsessed with the power of Sargeras!
VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission3ExchangeB_01	Gul'dan died trying to obtain the Eye of Sargeras. Have you learned nothing from his failure?!
VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission3ExchangeC_01	Tyrande was a fool to free you.
VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission3ExchangeD_01	How many must die before you are satisfied?
VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission3ExchangeE_01	I will hunt you the ends of the earth. I swear it!
VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4Victory_01	You're insane!
VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	I wish the demons had taken your tongue instead of your eyes.
VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2HeroPower_01	Atone for your crimes!
VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2HeroPower_02	You have gone too far.
VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2HeroPower_03	Your prison awaits!
VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2Loss_01	It is finally over. My watch can end.
VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2Idle_01	Centuries in a cell are nothing compared to your treachery.
VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2Idle_02	Your brother Malfurion has always been too soft on you.
VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission2Idle_03	How long can you avoid your responsibilities to your homeland? Your people?
VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4ExchangeC_04	The Scourge killed her!
VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission8ExchangeD_02	Their fury pales before mine, Illidan.
VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission8ExchangeE_02	I told you… to the ends of the earth. And I meant it.
VO_Story_Hero_Maiev_Female_NightElf_Story_Illidan_Mission8Victory_01	It is finished. You are beaten.
	
VO_Story_Minion_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Illidan_Mission4ExchangeC_05	That… may not be true.
VO_Story_Minion_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Illidan_Mission5ExchangeD_01	Our warriors will fight to the end!
VO_Story_Minion_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Illidan_Mission6ExchangeA_03	So are you.
VO_Story_Minion_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Illidan_Mission7ExchangeB_01	Be careful, Illidan. If he controls the obelisks, we won't be able to reach the Frozen Throne.
VO_Story_Minion_Kaelthas_Male_BloodElf_Story_Illidan_Mission7ExchangeC_02	You've taken everything I've cared for. Vengeance is all I have left.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Velas_Male_Undead_Story_Illidan_Mission4EmoteResponse_01	What say you?
VO_Story_Hero_Velas_Male_Undead_Story_Illidan_Mission4Loss_01	The Lich King calls for your blades…
VO_Story_Hero_Velas_Male_Undead_Story_Illidan_Mission4Idle_01	More soldiers to serve the Frozen Throne…
VO_Story_Hero_Velas_Male_Undead_Story_Illidan_Mission4Idle_02	Journey to Northrend and see our might with your own eyes.
VO_Story_Hero_Velas_Male_Undead_Story_Illidan_Mission4Idle_03	None can slow the path of the Scourge.
VO_Story_Hero_Velas_Male_Undead_Story_IllidanMission4Attack_01	Aah!
VO_Story_Hero_Velas_Male_Undead_Story_Illidan_Mission4Death_01	Agh!
	
VO_Story_Hero_Magtheridon_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission5Intro_01	My might cannot be denied!
VO_Story_Hero_Magtheridon_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission5ExchangeA_01	I am the Lord of Outland! My citadel is too vast for you to conquer!
VO_Story_Hero_Magtheridon_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission5Victory_01	Who are you, stranger? Were you sent here by the Legion to test me?
VO_Story_Hero_Magtheridon_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	A pointless diversion.
VO_Story_Hero_Magtheridon_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2HeroPower_01	Away with these tiresome gnats!
VO_Story_Hero_Magtheridon_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2HeroPower_02	Puny upstarts, all of you!
VO_Story_Hero_Magtheridon_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2HeroPower_03	Outland is MINE.
VO_Story_Hero_Magtheridon_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2Loss_01	I have shown you what true fear is!
VO_Story_Hero_Magtheridon_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2Idle_01	I conquered this broken world years ago. No one could stop me.
VO_Story_Hero_Magtheridon_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2Idle_02	Your motley allies cannot win against the power of the Legion!
VO_Story_Hero_Magtheridon_Male_Demon_Story_Illidan_Mission2Idle_03	We demons often use mortals like you to do our bidding… I wonder, who is using YOU?
	
VO_Story_Hero_Akama_Male_Draenei_Story_Illidan_Mission5ExchangeB_01	We draenei have long fought the demons alone. With your aid, we can end their curse forever.
VO_Story_Hero_Akama_Male_Draenei_Story_Illidan_Mission5ExchangeB_03	We are yours to command.
VO_Story_Hero_Akama_Male_Draenei_Story_Illidan_Mission5ExchangeE_02	You have our deepest gratitude.
VO_Story_Hero_Akama_Male_Draenei_Story_Illidan_Mission8Intro_03	We've come to end your reign, Illidan. All of Outland shall be free!
VO_Story_Hero_Akama_Male_Draenei_Story_Illidan_Mission8ExchangeB_01	We strike now! 
VO_Story_Hero_Akama_Male_Draenei_Story_Illidan_Mission8ExchangeC_01	The Betrayer must fall!
VO_Story_Hero_Akama_Male_Draenei_Story_Illidan_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	You are no 'lord' of mine.
VO_Story_Hero_Akama_Male_Draenei_Story_Illidan_Mission2HeroPower_01	Feel the pain you have wrought!
VO_Story_Hero_Akama_Male_Draenei_Story_Illidan_Mission2HeroPower_02	Suffer, Betrayer!
VO_Story_Hero_Akama_Male_Draenei_Story_Illidan_Mission2HeroPower_03	We've endured enough!
VO_Story_Hero_Akama_Male_Draenei_Story_Illidan_Mission2Loss_01	The Light will bless these dismal halls once again… I swear it.
VO_Story_Hero_Akama_Male_Draenei_Story_Illidan_Mission2Idle_01	Mine is a broken world and a broken race… but I have not lost hope.
VO_Story_Hero_Akama_Male_Draenei_Story_Illidan_Mission2Idle_02	Long have I silently schemed to overthrow you!
VO_Story_Hero_Akama_Male_Draenei_Story_Illidan_Mission2Idle_03	You have become no better than the demons you claim to resist.
	
VO_Story_Hero_Anubarak_Male_Nerubian_Story_Illidan_Mission6ExchangeA_01	Yes, master.
VO_Story_Hero_Anubarak_Male_Nerubian_Story_Illidan_Mission6ExchangeB_01	I am the ancient king of Azjol-Nerub, now enthralled to the Lich King.
VO_Story_Hero_Anubarak_Male_Nerubian_Story_Illidan_Mission6ExchangeD_02	You forget one thing.
VO_Story_Hero_Anubarak_Male_Nerubian_Story_Illidan_Mission6ExchangeD_04	Arthas.
VO_Story_Hero_Anubarak_Male_Nerubian_Story_Illidan_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	All is futile.
VO_Story_Hero_Anubarak_Male_Nerubian_Story_Illidan_Mission2HeroPower_01	I feed upon your anguish.
VO_Story_Hero_Anubarak_Male_Nerubian_Story_Illidan_Mission2HeroPower_02	Feel the venom of Nerub!
VO_Story_Hero_Anubarak_Male_Nerubian_Story_Illidan_Mission2HeroPower_03	Oblivion awaits!
VO_Story_Hero_Anubarak_Male_Nerubian_Story_Illidan_Mission2Loss_01	Defeat only brings you closer to us.
VO_Story_Hero_Anubarak_Male_Nerubian_Story_Illidan_Mission2Idle_01	Even in death, battle brings glory!
VO_Story_Hero_Anubarak_Male_Nerubian_Story_Illidan_Mission2Idle_02	Arthas has come a very long way. You are no match for him now.
VO_Story_Hero_Anubarak_Male_Nerubian_Story_Illidan_Mission2Idle_03	The secrets of Northrend weave endless poisoned webs.
VO_TB_KT_Anubarak_Male_CryptLord_PathofKT_Boss03_Death_01	Aaagh!

VO_Story_Hero_Anetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7ExchangeF_01	I am summoned.
VO_Story_Minion_Anetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7Attack_01	Your world is doomed!
VO_Story_Minion_Anetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7Attack_02	Let fire rain!
VO_Story_Minion_Anetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7Attack_03	Scream for me.
VO_Story_Minion_Anetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7Death_01	<_Death exertion_>
VO_Story_Minion_Anetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7Play_01	I have returned!
VO_Story_Hero_Bolvar_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7Death_01	<_Death exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_Bolvar_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7EmoteResponse_01	Hold your tongue.
VO_Story_Hero_Bolvar_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7ExchangeA_01	We've had enough of the Horde and demons around here!
VO_Story_Hero_Bolvar_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7ExchangeB_01	Charge!
VO_Story_Hero_Bolvar_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7ExchangeC_01	Hold the line.
VO_Story_Hero_Bolvar_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7ExchangeH_02	Courage! We must not give up.
VO_Story_Hero_Bolvar_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7HeroPower_01	To arms!
VO_Story_Hero_Bolvar_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7HeroPower_02	Press forward!
VO_Story_Hero_Bolvar_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7HeroPower_03	For the King!
VO_Story_Hero_Bolvar_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7HeroPower_04	For the Alliance!
VO_Story_Hero_Bolvar_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7HeroPower_05	For Stormwind!
VO_Story_Hero_Bolvar_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7Idle_01	Remain vigilant, soldiers.
VO_Story_Hero_Bolvar_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7Idle_02	You're nothing without your demons in front of you.
VO_Story_Hero_Bolvar_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7Idle_03	Wait for my signal.
VO_Story_Hero_Bolvar_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7Intro_01	There she is. Get her, men!
VO_Story_Hero_Bolvar_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7Loss_01	Today we celebrate a glorious victory!
VO_Story_Hero_Bolvar_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7Victory_01	The demon is too strong. Fall back!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3ExchangeB_01	Tamsin, I urge you to be careful. Lives are at stake.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3ExchangeB_03	Mission?
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3ExchangeF_01	Stand back. Let old Bru'kan handle this.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3Victory_01	The path be clear and now we must hurry. They will be holding Dawngrasp in the Stockade.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4Death_01	<_Medium death exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4EmoteResponse_01	How could you betray us?
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeA_02	Too well I know you, Tamsin Roame. And your lies.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeB_01	We be here for Dawngrasp. Nothing more. I'll not be letting you hurt the people of this city. I'll protect them from you.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeC_01	Argh! Your magic is cruel, Tamsin.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeD_01	Tamsin…don't do this.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4HeroPower_01	Enough!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4Idle_01	Look at me! I am not getting any younger, you know.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4Intro_02	Heh. It would not be the first time.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4Loss_01	I am sorry it came to this, Tamsin.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8ExchangeB_01	You must call off that dreadlord. The city is in danger.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8ExchangeC_01	You had so much potential.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8ExchangeD_01	You cannot break my defenses.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8ExchangeF_01	Tamsin…no…please!
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8ExchangeG_01	I'm your father. You can't -- !
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8ExchangeH_01	My mind is going…
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8ExchangeI_01	Where…where am I?
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8Intro_01	Tamsin, what have you done?
VO_Story_Hero_Elfarran_Female_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3Death_01	<_Death exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_Elfarran_Female_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3EmoteResponse_01	Prepare to fight.
VO_Story_Hero_Elfarran_Female_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3ExchangeA_01	I have faced larger forces than yours singlehandedly.
VO_Story_Hero_Elfarran_Female_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3HeroPower_01	Take up your arms.
VO_Story_Hero_Elfarran_Female_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3HeroPower_02	Let balance be restored!
VO_Story_Hero_Elfarran_Female_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3HeroPower_03	Reinforcements!
VO_Story_Hero_Elfarran_Female_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3Idle_01	Stay vigilant, troops!
VO_Story_Hero_Elfarran_Female_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3Idle_02	You have summoned your last demon, warlock.
VO_Story_Hero_Elfarran_Female_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3Idle_03	Hold the line. Be ready for anything.
VO_Story_Hero_Elfarran_Female_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3Intro_01	Do not let the Horde breach our harbor!
VO_Story_Hero_Elfarran_Female_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3Loss_01	We have routed the enemy. Now to the Blue Recluse.
VO_Story_Hero_Elfarran_Female_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission3_02	Ready our defenses! This is a Horde ambush!
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5Death_01	<_Death exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5EmoteResponse_01	We will defend our kingdom to the last man!
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeA_01	This city -- its people -- we will stand against you!
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeB_01	You'd better watch yourself. There's more to me than meets the eye.
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeC_01	You will never outlast the Rat King!
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeD_01	You'll find the peddlers of Stormwind drive a hard bargain.
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeE_01	A simple peasant -- the backbone of the Alliance.
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeF_01	They're always ready for work.
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeG_01	You better buy something. He hasn't got all day.
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeH_01	This librarian knows you're overdue for some pain.
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeI_01	Perhaps you're interested in exotic wares?
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeJ_01	If you defeat an auctioneer, you get to keep their mallet. 
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeK_01	It is wise to stay nourished during a fight.
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeL_01	The bank is a good place to keep your treasures, don't you know.
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeM_01	You will now face our fiercest -- HEY! Get down off of that mailbox.
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeN_01	Our greatest defender is Stormwind itself!
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeO_01	Don't worry. This one promises his wealth will trickle down.
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5HeroPower_01	Trade you!
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5HeroPower_02	What a deal.
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5HeroPower_03	Oooh!
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5Idle_01	We will fight to the last manchego.
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5Idle_02	Live brie or die.
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5Idle_03	Are you feeling a little bleu?
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5Idle_04	I know, these are cheesy.
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5Idle_05	<_Sigh_>… This stinks.
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5Intro_01	A Forsaken warlock, in the streets of Stormwind?!
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5Loss_01	Send word to Master Shaw. The threat has been neutralized.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3ExchangeE_01	Hey, look! There are fishies swimming in the harbor.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4Death_01	<_Medium death exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4EmoteResponse_01	Maybe we all just need to eat something.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeK_01	Tamsin?
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeL_01	What…what have you done to our friends? They are hurt!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeM_01	We are supposed to rescue Dawngrasp together.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeN_01	You want to hurt more people. I will stop you.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeO_01	I do not want to do this, but…
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4HeroPower_01	<_Sigh_>
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4Idle_01	If we stop fighting, we could find animals to play with in the park.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4Loss_01	Tamsin, are you okay? I did not mean to -- oh no…
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4Victory_01	Tamsin! You hurt me…
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission2_02	We have to rescue Dawngrasp! They are being held prisoner in the Stormwind Stockade.
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2Death_01	<_Death exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	Loose lips sink ships.
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2ExchangeA_02	Oh, well Captain Hooktusk can help you with that…if the price be right.
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2ExchangeB_02	I be brave enough, aye. And my men be dim-witted enough.
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2ExchangeC_01	Let's see if you got what it takes. Knock me down, and I'll get you to Stormwind. 
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2ExchangeD_01	Why do you want to go to Stormwind, anyway?
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2ExchangeE_01	Anchors away!
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2ExchangeF_01	Hoist the Mizzen!
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2HeroPower_01	Fire!
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2HeroPower_02	Cannonball!
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2HeroPower_03	There she blows!
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2HeroPower_04	Scuttle them!
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2HeroPower_05	No prey, no pay!
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2HeroPower_06	No quarter!
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2Idle_01	You're slower than a sail-less raft.
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2Idle_02	You're slower than a fin-less shark.
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2Idle_03	Hurry up now! I'm running out of metaphors.
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2Intro_02	Greenskin be in Westfall on a job. But if you know him, give me the 600 gold he owes me!
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2Loss_01	The sharks going feast tonight!
VO_Story_Hero_Hooktusk_Female_Troll_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2Victory_01	My crew'll take you to Stormwind. But you pay me up front.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1Death_01	<_death exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1EmoteResponse_01	Your words are poison.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1ExchangeA_01	Cariel can protect you no longer, Forsaken wretch!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1ExchangeB_01	I journeyed with your sister across the Barrens. She risked her life to find you. Now you cast her aside. Why?
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1ExchangeC_01	You speak without honor. She is your sister.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1ExchangeD_02	No!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1HeroPower_01	<_Grunt_>
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1HeroPower_02	Prepare!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1HeroPower_03	Feel my fury!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1Idle_01	You mock me with your idleness.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1Idle_02	What would Illidan do?
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1Idle_03	Revenge is a dish best roasted in felfire.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1Intro_01	You will never leave Dreadmist Peak. Face my glaive!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1Loss_01	It is finished. So why do I feel…empty?
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1Victory_02	No! Warlock -- get back here. I'm not finished. No!!!
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission1_03	My dear, brilliant Tamsin. Go to the Barrens, seek my ally, Kazakus. He will guide you to Dreadmist Peak. Retrieve the Demon Seed and shards of naaru. Then you will have your power.
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission1_04	Then you will have your revenge.
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission8_02	Yes, Tamsin, you have created an adequate diversion. But what is this? One last soldier too foolish to run away?
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3ExchangeD_02	Aye, aye. You heard her, sea dogs. Attack!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3ExchangeH_02	I'll keelhaul you landlubbers!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4Death_01	<_Medium death exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4EmoteResponse_01	I should have known.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeE_01	Not if I have anything to say about it.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeF_02	No…but I can stop you!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeH_01	Who is this Anetheron anyway?
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeI_02	Champion? You don't speak of heroism. You speak of mass destruction.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeJ_01	Maybe I can't defeat you, Tamsin, but someone will.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4HeroPower_01	Lok'tar ogar!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4Idle_01	I'm not going anywhere.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4Loss_01	I wish things could have gone differently.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission4_02	What is this portal you speak of, Tamsin? Just what are you planning?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_BOMSelect_01	I am Tamsin Roame. I will destroy Stormwind and everyone in it!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1ExchangeA_02	You are the one who will need protection. 
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1ExchangeB_02	Why? Why not? Who cares about family, anyway?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1ExchangeC_02	Eh.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1ExchangeD_01	You are trying so hard to stop me, and yet, deep down, you know I will get what I want. I always do.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1Intro_02	Puh-lease…I could vanquish you with a snap of my fingers.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission1Victory_01	Sorry, old man. I have places to be and demons to summon.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2ExchangeA_01	I don't care about the goblin's debts. I need him for a small task.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2ExchangeB_01	I need someone to smuggle my henchmen and me into Stormwind Harbor. Are you brave enough for such an endeavor?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2ExchangeC_02	You'll regret testing me, pirate.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2ExchangeD_02	I'm planning a reunion with my father.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2Intro_01	Where is Captain Greenskin? I order you to take me to him!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission2Victory_02	Don't worry, you'll get your money. Rokara, give her your money.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3ExchangeA_02	But you've never faced me.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3ExchangeB_02	Quiet, old troll. I must complete my mission.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3ExchangeC_01	This is Stormwind's best?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3ExchangeC_02	Where are the paladins? I promised my imps armor-clad playthings.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3ExchangeD_01	Rokara, get those pirates into the fight!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3ExchangeE_02	Get in there and FIGHT them, Guff, or I'll fire you out of a cannon.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3ExchangeG_01	Behold…with this power, I shall lay waste to the Alliance. Stormwind will burn!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3ExchangeH_01	Rokara seems to have found her calling.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3Intro_02	What are you all standing around for? Attack them!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission3Victory_02	That's your problem, now. I have a portal to open.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeA_01	Honestly, Bru'kan, why would you cross me? All I'm after is a reunion with my dear old father.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeB_02	Like you protected the Darkspear tribe from the Kul Tirans? Oh dear. Sounds like Stormwind is doomed.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeD_02	Look to my portal, Bru'kan. Anetheron shall return!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeF_01	Say what you want, my scrappy little orc-ling. You cannot stop the march of fate.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeG_01	Why would you stop me? I'm going to bring an end to this generations-old conflict.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeG_02	I will destroy the Alliance with Anetheron at my side.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeH_02	He is a dreadlord of tremendous power. My benefactor has given me the wisdom to summon him, to use his might against my enemies.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeI_01	Serve me, Rokara, serve Anetheron, and you will be heralded as the champion of the Horde.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeI_03	I know! Isn't it marvelous?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeK_02	This doesn't concern you, Guff. No reason to get your hooves dirty.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeL_02	They attacked me. I had to defend myself.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeM_02	You should do that…but I have to go my own way.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4ExchangeP_01	Wow! I like your new look, Guff. But I should stop you before you get your…bearings.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4Intro_01	You're making a big mistake, old troll.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission4Victory_02	It couldn't be helped. See you in the next life.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeA_02	What are you going to do? Fight me with feta?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeB_02	I won't say it. It's too easy. Don't say it.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeC_02	No kings, only vermin.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeD_02	I'll drive them out of town.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeE_02	Funny -- I'd use them as cannon fodder.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeF_02	"Yes m'lord! Yes m'lord!" Ugggch. Give it a rest.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeG_02	Sorry. I'm just browsing.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeH_02	I'm not really much of a reader. Unless it's a book about DEMONS.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeI_02	I'm interested in defeating anyone you throw at me.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeJ_02	Sold!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeK_02	The bread and my anger are rising.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeL_02	Are you here to fight or offer me financial advice?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeM_02	Now that is something I can dance to.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeN_02	Pah! Just another brick in the wall.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5ExchangeO_02	Eat the rich.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission5Intro_02	Keep walking, cheesemonger.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission6ExchangeA_02	Light? When I see that shard, I see a thing of the Void…of shadow…
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission6ExchangeB_01	You can wield that power, you know. You might even become powerful enough to defeat me. Embrace the Void!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission6ExchangeC_02	Maybe I can't…but the shard can…
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission6ExchangeE_01	Oh, this is too good. Look at you!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission6ExchangeF_02	Not a chance.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission6Intro_02	See, now you're just begging me to destroy your mind.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission6Victory_01	The way is clear. Rise, Anetheron. RISE!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7ExchangeA_02	Demons? Oh sweetie, you ain't seen nothing yet.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7ExchangeB_02	Look at all the pretty horses.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7ExchangeC_02	Little toy soldiers, all in a row.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7ExchangeD_01	Put your faith in my might! Ha ha ha!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7ExchangeE_01	Blood and shadow!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7ExchangeF_02	Yes! To destroy! Burn them all.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7ExchangeG_01	Annihilate them! All of them.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission7Intro_02	Oh, ho, ho. You will regret this interruption.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8ExchangeA_01	Stormwind missed all the carnage when the Scourge came to Scholomance. I thought, why should they miss out?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8ExchangeB_02	Don't worry, father. You won't remember any of this…once I burn away your mind!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8ExchangeC_02	I am fulfilling it.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8ExchangeD_02	I don't need to.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8ExchangeE_01	A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8ExchangeE_02	Forget me not.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8ExchangeE_03	I claim your mind.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8ExchangeE_04	I hope that last memory wasn't important!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8ExchangeE_05	Once your mindless body is under my control, I promise to take good care of you.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8ExchangeE_06	I can't wait to see what kind of monster you become.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8ExchangeI_02	Now the fun begins. Goodbye, father.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_Mission8Intro_02	I have taught this kingdom a lesson, father.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_Mission8Victory_01	I have summoned the demon. I have served my revenge. There is but one more task before me.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_Mission8Victory_02	Sister. My dear little sister. Come to the cemetery, Cariel. I'll be waiting.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission1_01	I was born in Stormwind, studied at Scholomance, but when the Scourge came, my kingdom abandoned me to be slaughtered.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission1_02	Though I rose again as a Forsaken, I craved vengeance against the heartless fools in Stormwind who left me to suffer. Fortunately, I found a clever benefactor to help me achieve my goal.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission2_01	With the power to summon Anetheron in hand, I needed a way to gain entry to Stormwind. Fortunately, some of my old flunkies were willing to help.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission2_03	Do not worry, my little funnel cake. My benefactor told me there's a pirate captain in Booty Bay who can smuggle us in through Stormwind Harbor.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission3_01	The pirates smuggled my crew north to Stormwind. Everything was going according to plan, until Guff started waving to the dock guards we were trying to sneak past.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission4_01	Invading Stormwind, I expected to take on everything the Alliance could throw at me. What I didn't expect was for my one-time companions to get in my way.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission4_03	Wouldn't you like to know?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission5_01	At last I was free to continue my mission, but the path to the Cathedral was well-defended. Fortunately, I knew the city well from my youth.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission5_02	Security was weak in the Trade District. I chose to sneak through there.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission6_01	Outside the cathedral, I began to construct my summoning portal.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission6_03	You! I know you…you're that priestess Kazakus mentioned. You seek the shards of naaru. Oh, this will be fun!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission7_01	The time has come. The portal is ready. Step forth, Anetheron. Burn this city to ash!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission8_01	Stormwind is in flames. Anetheron is loose. The soldiers who have not fallen have fled...My lady.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission8_03	Ugch. It's my dear father. Do not fret, Lady Prestor. I will handle him.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Tamsin_Mission6Death_01	HOW?!
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Tamsin_Mission6EmoteResponse_01	Open your heart to the light.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Tamsin_Mission6ExchangeA_01	By the Light of the naaru, I will stand against you.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Tamsin_Mission6ExchangeB_02	Never!
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Tamsin_Mission6ExchangeC_01	My faith is pure. You will not corrupt me.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Tamsin_Mission6ExchangeD_01	No…N-AAAAH!!!!
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Tamsin_Mission6Idle_01	The naaru shares wisdom with those who listen.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Tamsin_Mission6Intro_01	I am stronger than you could ever believe.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Tamsin_Mission6Loss_01	Such a waste. I should tell the others.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Tamsin_PreMission6_02	Hold, warlock. You will summon no demons in this sanctum of the Light.
VO_Story_Hero_ShadowPriestXyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Tamsin_Mission6Death_01	No, please! Not…the demon!
VO_Story_Hero_ShadowPriestXyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Tamsin_Mission6EmoteResponse_01	You will not talk your way out of this.

VO_Story_Hero_Anetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission5Death_01	<_Death exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_Anetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission5EmoteResponse_01	I hear the sound of futility.
VO_Story_Hero_Anetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission5ExchangeC_02	You are feeble.
VO_Story_Hero_Anetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission5ExchangeE_02	What do you hope to accomplish?

VO_Story_Hero_Anetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission5Idle_01	My grip tightens.
VO_Story_Hero_Anetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission5Idle_02	<_Laugh_>
VO_Story_Hero_Anetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission5Idle_03	I love the smell of felfire in the morning.

VO_Story_Hero_Anetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission5Loss_01	Pity, no time for a slow demise.
VO_Story_Hero_Anetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission5Victory_03	I have only tapped a fraction of my power. Behold!
VO_Story_Hero_BigAnetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Carrion_01	The swarm is eager to feed.
VO_Story_Hero_BigAnetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Carrion_02	Pestilence upon you!
VO_Story_Hero_BigAnetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Carrion_03	Heart of the Swarm!

VO_Story_Hero_BigAnetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Inferno_02	Let fire rain from above!
VO_Story_Hero_BigAnetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Inferno_03	Towering Infernal!
VO_Story_Hero_BigAnetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Intro_02	You are the defender of a doomed world. Flee and prolong your pathetic life.
VO_Story_Hero_BigAnetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Victory_01	Not again. I must not…FAIL!
VO_Story_Hero_BigAnetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Sleep_01	You look tired.
VO_Story_Hero_BigAnetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Sleep_02	Sweet dreams.
VO_Story_Hero_BigAnetheron_Male_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Sleep_03	Eternal rest.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_BOMSelect_01	I am Cariel Roame -- paladin of the Silver Hand  -- and if I can save my sister, I will.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission2ExchangeA_01	Kurtrus, please. She is my sister. What would you do for your family?
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission2ExchangeC_01	Let me help. We can stop this together.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission2ExchangeD_01	Everyone has tried to help you. Remember your friend? You'll need us to defeat Anetheron.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission2Intro_01	Don't do this, Kurtrus.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission2Victory_01	Cease! Come with me to Stormwind. There is still time to stop Tamsin.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3ExchangeB_01	Please, Father, now is not the time for training.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3ExchangeB_03	That's not…it's…complicated.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3ExchangeC_02	I found Tamsin. She's a warlock now, and Forsaken. I left my post to find her.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3ExchangeD_01	I am sorry, Father, but I had to see her for myself.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3ExchangeD_02	She has changed, but by the holy Light, I think there is hope for her.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3Intro_01	Father, I have returned from Kalimdor, and I bring news!
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3Victory_02	It's Tamsin. It must be. I need to warn my friends.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3Victory_04	All right, Father. Be safe. I'll see you soon.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission4ExchangeA_01	The leader is flying out of my reach!
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission4ExchangeB_01	Tavish, where are the others?
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission4ExchangeC_01	You shall not win this day, demon.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission4ExchangeD_01	Tavish, you all right?
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission4Intro_01	Tavish, you provide overwatch. We'll handle this together.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission4Victory_02	Keep them at bay as long as you can. I'm going to find that portal and close it. 
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission5ExchangeA_01	Kurtrus, are you all right?
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission5ExchangeB_02	This is bigger than us. Now fight!
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission5ExchangeC_01	Let him go!
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission5ExchangeD_01	I will free you!
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission5ExchangeF_01	Yes!
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission5ExchangeF_03	It's not over yet. Let's do this.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission5Intro_01	Anetheron…release him. Now!
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission5Victory_01	He's weakening!
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission6ExchangeA_02	One more battle…and your family will have peace. 
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Heal_01	Embrace the Light.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Heal_02	I heal you.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Intro_01	This is not your place, demon. We will drive you out.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Rez_01	Rise up!
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Rez_02	It's not over yet.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Victory_02	We did it, Kurtrus. It's over. Your family can rest in peace.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Victory_04	I know what it means to see things through, no matter the cost…for family.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission7ExchangeA_01	It's me, Father. It's your daughter.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission7ExchangeB_01	It's Cariel, Father. Don't you recognize me?
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission7ExchangeC_02	I came here to save you. But this is...
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission7ExchangeD_02	What you have done is beyond forgiveness. You cannot be saved. Cannot be helped.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission7Intro_01	Father…what has she done to you?
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission7Victory_01	Forgive me, Father.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission8ExchangeA_02	Not revenge. Justice.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission8ExchangeC_02	After Mom…after you…Father was broken. You were gone. I needed to be the good daughter, for once.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission8ExchangeD_01	Justice demands retribution.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission8Intro_01	I can't save you, but I can save others from you.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission8Victory_02	Tamsin…I'm sorry.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_PreMission1_01	Tamsin was always the favorite. She was perfect at everything, and Father made sure we both knew it.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_PreMission2_02	Kurtrus? I… We're still in the Barrens. Tamsin's gone?
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_PreMission3_01	With Kurtrus's fury cooled for now, we returned to Stormwind and waited for Tamsin to make her move.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_PreMission3_02	Years ago, when the Scourge cut through Lordaeron, I thought I'd lost Tamsin forever.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_PreMission3_03	As I reached Father's door, my heart was filled with turmoil. How would he respond? His long-lost child had returned.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_PreMission4_01	Demons crashed through Tamsin's portal, overrunning Stormwind in minutes. I took to the streets, fighting my way through the fiends in search of my friends.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_PreMission4_02	In the Dwarven District, I found a familiar face.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_PreMission5_01	Anetheron stood before the portal, towering and brimming with hate.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_PreMission5_02	He had Kurtrus caught in his grip -- at his mercy -- I had to save him.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_PreMission6_01	Anetheron is going to destroy Stormwind. We have to stop him -- it's now or never.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_PreMission7_01	Wounded in the battle, Kurtrus stayed behind to heal and process his long sought vengeance.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_PreMission7_02	With Anetheron defeated, I followed Tamsin's trail to the graveyard.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_PreMission7_03	A chill went up my spine when I saw an undead fiend come towards me.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_PreMission8_01	Tamsin…I believed in you. I sacrificed for you. I wanted to prove there was still good in you. But this…this is too much.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_PreMission8_03	How dare you?
VO_Story_Hero_YoungCariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1Death_01	<_Death Exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_YoungCariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1ExchangeA_02	They're not degenerates. They're my friends!
VO_Story_Hero_YoungCariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1ExchangeB_02	Yes, Father.
VO_Story_Hero_YoungCariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1ExchangeD_01	For the hundredth time, I do not want to join the Silver Hand!
VO_Story_Hero_YoungCariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1ExchangeE_02	Lucky?!
VO_Story_Hero_YoungCariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1Greetings_01	Welcome home.
VO_Story_Hero_YoungCariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1Intro_01	I've been training too. I bet you I win this time.
VO_Story_Hero_YoungCariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1Oops_01	Oops.
VO_Story_Hero_YoungCariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1Thanks_01	Thanks.
VO_Story_Hero_YoungCariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1Threaten_01	I'm telling Father!
VO_Story_Hero_YoungCariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1Victory_01	I did it! I actually did it!
VO_Story_Hero_YoungCariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1WellPlayed_01	Well played.
VO_Story_Hero_YoungCariel_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1Wow_01	Wow.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1ExchangeB_01	Impressive technique, Tamsin! Cariel -- keep your guard up.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1ExchangeC_02	She could have been a knight if she'd worked a little harder.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1Victory_03	Enough! Tamsin wins. As expected.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3Death_01	<_Death exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3EmoteResponse_01	Quiet, daughter. I need to think.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3ExchangeA_01	Let's see if your martial skills have improved at all.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3ExchangeB_02	What you need is training and discipline. I received a report that you abandoned your post in the Barrens.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3ExchangeC_01	Explain yourself!
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3ExchangeC_03	Tamsin?
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3HeroPower_01	Armor up!
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3HeroPower_02	Training gave me a strong defense.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3HeroPower_03	I'll block every strike.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3Idle_01	Come on…I'm waiting.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3Idle_02	You always were slow to respond.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3Idle_03	You owe me an explanation.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3Intro_02	It better be good. You have a lot of explaining to do.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3Loss_01	Next time, take your training more seriously.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3Victory_01	What is happening?!
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission3Victory_03	You need to defend your kingdom. I must rendezvous with the rest of the city watch.
VO_Story_Hero_Cornelius_Male_Human_BOM_Cariel_PreMission1_02	Now I want you both to fight as HARD as you can. No holding back.  I want to see what Tamsin has been learning at Scholomance.
VO_Story_Hero_Monstrosity_Male_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission7Death_01	<_Death exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_Monstrosity_Male_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission7EmoteResponse_01	Stay away from Tamsin!
VO_Story_Hero_Monstrosity_Male_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission7ExchangeA_02	Tamsin? Is that you?
VO_Story_Hero_Monstrosity_Male_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission7ExchangeB_02	Not Tamsin? Then destroy!
VO_Story_Hero_Monstrosity_Male_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission7HeroPower_01	What is happening to me?
VO_Story_Hero_Monstrosity_Male_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission7HeroPower_02	It grows.
VO_Story_Hero_Monstrosity_Male_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission7HeroPower_03	Consume!
VO_Story_Hero_Monstrosity_Male_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission7Idle_01	I feel so…strange.
VO_Story_Hero_Monstrosity_Male_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission7Idle_02	Leave this place.
VO_Story_Hero_Monstrosity_Male_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission7Idle_03	The end is nigh.
VO_Story_Hero_Monstrosity_Male_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission7Intro_02	It…hurts!
VO_Story_Hero_Monstrosity_Male_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission7Loss_01	You too will power my weapon.
VO_Story_Hero_Monstrosity_Male_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission7Victory_02	I am…free…
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission2Death_01	<_death exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	Hold your tongue, paladin.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission2ExchangeA_01	What do you think I would do?
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission2ExchangeB_01	I should never have trusted you. I was so close.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission2ExchangeC_02	The path of revenge is too narrow to walk side by side.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission2ExchangeD_02	I do not need Aranna's help. I do not need Illidan. And I certainly do not need you.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission2HeroPower_01	My glaives are sharp!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission2HeroPower_02	Prepare!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission2HeroPower_03	Feel my fury!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission2Idle_01	Why would you stand against me?
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission2Idle_02	Hmph.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission2Idle_03	Every idle second is wasted.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission2Intro_02	You stole my vengeance!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission2Loss_01	Your warlock sister will suffer the same fate.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission2Victory_02	You would help me, even now? I will go with you, but this battle is mine alone.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Attack_01	At last!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Attack_02	Feel my fury!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Attack_03	Feel my glaive!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Death_01	No!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Death_02	I can't --
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Death_03	Huargh!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission6ExchangeA_01	I could not have reached this point without you, Cariel. I was wrong to doubt you.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Heal_01	Thank you.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission6IsDead_01	I need your help, Cariel!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Play_01	The time has come!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Rez_01	The time has come!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Trigger_01	Stormwind must not fall!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Trigger_02	You must prepare!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Trigger_03	Prepare!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission6Victory_03	You fought with fire in your heart.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_PreMission2_01	Wake up, paladin. Your warlock sister has absconded with the shard of naaru.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_PreMission2_03	On your feet. You must answer for her crimes.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_PreMission6_02	This is the moment I have long awaited. Now is the reckoning. Stand and face me, dreadlord!
VO_Story_Minion_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission5ExchangeA_02	He has me in his grasp! I must break free.
VO_Story_Minion_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission5ExchangeB_01	You would still help…after all I have done?
VO_Story_Minion_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission5ExchangeD_02	Yes! It's working.
VO_Story_Minion_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission5ExchangeE_01	Almost…out!
VO_Story_Minion_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission5ExchangeF_02	I am free. Thank you, Cariel.
VO_Story_Minion_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Cariel_Mission5Victory_02	Don't be so sure.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission7ExchangeC_01	I see you found my new creation. A vast improvement on our father when he was alive, don't you think, Care?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission7ExchangeD_01	You won't even compliment me on my incredible display of necromancy? You really are the worst.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8Death_01	<_Death exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8EmoteResponse_01	Idle chatter? That's my bit.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8ExchangeA_01	Everyone seems to want revenge. Me, that demon hunter, even my kind benefactor. And now I suppose you'll want revenge too.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8ExchangeB_01	A warlock's powers require sacrifice. Pain. The Demon Seed counteracts this side effect. Spreads the love around.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8ExchangeC_01	Oh, Cariel, you were on your way to becoming such a splendid little cutthroat. How did you grow up to be so…boring?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8ExchangeC_03	You find a way to blame everything on me, don't you?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8ExchangeD_02	Justice…don't make me laugh. When the Scourge came, there was no justice. Not for me.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8ExchangeE_01	Ooh. I like Scariel.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8HeroPower_01	Look upon my works!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8HeroPower_02	I am all-powerful!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8HeroPower_03	Despair!
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8Idle_01	It's our final battle. Are you nervous?
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8Idle_02	I'm going to miss tormenting you.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8Idle_03	Do you remember that time I was kind to you? No? Me neither.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8Intro_02	Watching you fail is getting so old, sister.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8Loss_01	Give my regards to Father, Care.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8Low_01	This is not the end, sister. You will never be rid of me.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8Mill_01	Let's see what's in that mind of yours.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8Mill_02	A copper for your thoughts.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8Mill_03	You won't be needing this anymore.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8Mill_04	I'll burn away every happy memory you have of me.
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_Mission8Victory_01	Darkness embrace me. I feel…cold…
VO_Story_Hero_Tamsin_Female_Undead_BOM_Cariel_PreMission8_02	What can I say? The Light's not for everyone.
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1Death_01	<_Death exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1EmoteResponse_01	Is that your way of asking for mercy?
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1ExchangeA_01	Who have you been training with, anyway? Those degenerates you run with in Old Town?
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1ExchangeC_01	You're strong. Not as strong as me, of course, but still…
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1ExchangeE_01	Ah! Lucky hit.
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1ExchangeF_01	Dodge this!
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1HeroPower_01	I've got a little secret.
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1HeroPower_02	Bet you won't see this one coming.
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1HeroPower_03	Surprise, surprise.
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1HeroPower_04	Ooh! The Headmaster taught me this one.
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1HeroPower_05	You better watch out, Care.
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1HeroPower_06	Secrets, secrets, are sooo much fun.
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1Idle_01	Ugch…you're more tedious than Professor Omu's class.
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1Idle_02	Are you coming to terms with the fact that you've already lost?
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1Idle_03	Dad! Cariel's staring at me again.
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1Intro_02	No bet. For your own good, Care. You never win.
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1Loss_01	Oh, Care. Told you it wasn't smart to make that bet.
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_Mission1Victory_02	HA!
VO_Story_Hero_YoungTamsin_Female_Human_BOM_Cariel_PreMission1_03	Come on... let's get this over with.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Cariel_Mission4ExchangeA_02	Keep the demons off me, I'll deal with the big one.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Cariel_Mission4ExchangeB_02	Xyrella's at the cathedral, and ye can guess where Kurtrus went -- he's goin' after that blasted dreadlord.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Cariel_Mission4ExchangeB_03	Cutterbutter disappeared right when we got ta Stormwind. Haven't seen him since.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Cariel_Mission4ExchangeD_02	Don't worry about me, lassie. I got a huge gun!
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Cariel_Mission4Victory_01	Haha! That got him!
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Cariel_PreMission4_03	Ye standin' there with that warhammer just ta keep it warm? Swing it at the demons, why don't ye?
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Cariel_Mission4Attack_01	Look out below!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Cariel_Mission4Death_01	There're too many of them! I can't -- AGH!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Cariel_Mission4onHit_01	Get 'em off me!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Cariel_Mission4onHit_02	Keep 'em away from the tower, lassie!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Cariel_Mission4onHit_03	Gah!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Cariel_Mission4onHit_04	Oohoo! Takin' damage!
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Cariel_Mission4Play_01	Bearded Eagle -- in position.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Cariel_Mission4Trigger_01	<_Blunderbuss cocks, fires_>
VO_Story_Hero_Xurgon_Female_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission4Death_01	<_Death exertion_>
VO_Story_Hero_Xurgon_Female_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission4EmoteResponse_01	I've got my eyes on you.
VO_Story_Hero_Xurgon_Female_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission4ExchangeC_02	You shall not leave Stormwind alive!
VO_Story_Hero_Xurgon_Female_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission4HeroPower_01	Go forth.
VO_Story_Hero_Xurgon_Female_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission4HeroPower_02	I summon thee.
VO_Story_Hero_Xurgon_Female_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission4HeroPower_03	I call to you.
VO_Story_Hero_Xurgon_Female_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission4Idle_01	Climb up there and get that dwarf!
VO_Story_Hero_Xurgon_Female_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission4Idle_02	You cannot stay up there all day.
VO_Story_Hero_Xurgon_Female_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission4Idle_03	This time, the Nathrezim have no need for prisoners.
VO_Story_Hero_Xurgon_Female_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission4Intro_02	Anetheron calls for your destruction!
VO_Story_Hero_Xurgon_Female_Demon_BOM_Cariel_Mission4Loss_01	Anetheron will be pleased.

# General Drakkisath
VO_LETL_843H_Male_Dragonkin_Attack_01	You lack discipline.
VO_LETL_843H_Male_Dragonkin_Attack_02	Observe and learn, soldiers.
VO_LETL_843H_Male_Dragonkin_Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_LETL_843H_Male_Dragonkin_Idle_01	Blackrock Mountain is at my command.
VO_LETL_843H_Male_Dragonkin_Intro_01	I will protect the Spire.

# Rend Blackhand
VO_LETL_844H_Male_Orc_Attack_01	Beg for mercy.
VO_LETL_844H_Male_Orc_Attack_02	Not so fast!
VO_LETL_844H_Male_Orc_Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_LETL_844H_Male_Orc_Idle_01	The spire is ours, mercenaries.
VO_LETL_844H_Male_Orc_Intro_01	Let it be finished.

#Razorgore
VO_LETL_845H_Male_Dragonkin_Attack_01	<_roars_>
VO_LETL_845H_Male_Dragonkin_Attack_02	I'll have your heads!
VO_LETL_845H_Male_Dragonkin_Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_LETL_845H_Male_Dragonkin_Idle_01	It was foolish of you to come here.
VO_LETL_845H_Male_Dragonkin_Intro_01	You'll pay for your insolence, mortals.

#BOM Scabbs
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Beast_01	Any hunters in tonight? I see some animal companions over here.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Beast_02	These beasts are a burden.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Death_01	All right. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Demon_01	Now what possessed these demons to show up?
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Demon_02	Demons? <_Sigh_> Demons.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Dragon_01	Hey, the inn is flammable, you know.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Dragon_02	These ones can fight hard, but they take up a lot of space!
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Elemental_01	Elementary, my dear Cutterbutter.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Elemental_02	Need a drink? How about a fireball?
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1EmoteResponse_01	I tend bar. I'm used to listening to people's problems.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1ExchangeA_01	Well if it isn't my old sous chef…and apprentice in the spy trade.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1ExchangeA_03	Well you know most spies don't retire; they get retired. So all things considered -- pretty well.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1ExchangeB_02	Let's wait for the inn to clear out a bit. In the meantime, I want to see if your knives are still sharp.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1ExchangeC_02	We call it The Battlegrounds. It makes a big mess, but it's very popular.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1HeroPower_01	It's not the strongest, but it'll fight hard.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1HeroPower_02	It's good to get some minions in play.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1HeroPower_03	Go big or go home, I always say.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Idle_01	You always were a fine cook. Fastest knife in Gnomeregan.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Idle_02	I heard you took out a whole Venture Company operation.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Idle_03	I've heard rumors about suspcious folk lurking in Westfall. You know anything about that?
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Intro_01	All are welcome here. Just don't cause any trouble.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Loss_01	Don't take it too hard. Try again.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1LowHealth_01	Not bad, Agent. Your skills have improved.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Mech_01	Now don't let their metal bodies fool you, these ones have a lot of heart.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Mech_02	Hey, wanna do battle with a bucket of bolts?
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Murloc_01	Something's fishy, and it might be these little critters.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Murloc_02	Now I heard a rumor that you speak Murloc, Cutterbutter.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Pirate_01	These pirates refuse to pay, but at least they're engaged.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Pirate_02	Remember that time we chased those pirates out of Menethil Harbor? Those were the good old days.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Quilboar_01	These customers are a bit prickly.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Quilboar_02	Want to try our signature bacon flight? Maybe I should stick to funnel cakes.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Victory_01	Lady Katrana Prestor, advisor to young Anduin in King Varian's absence, has been gathering some magical objects that landed during the Night of Falling Stars.
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Victory_03	Something doesn't smell right. She's loosened city security and denied reinforcements to outlying Alliance regions. 
VO_Story_Hero_Bob_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Victory_05	You do your spy thing, Scabbs. Get to the bottom of this plot. I know you won't fail.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeF_Kurtrus_01	Are you the patron of these young mercenaries?
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeF_Kurtrus_03	It is good for the elders to take the young adventurers under their wings. I see wisdom in you. Perhaps you still have more to offer them.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAD_01	You are the lockpick who freed our Dawngrasp from the Stockade. They speak highly of you.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAE_01	Why don't you ask your Stormpike friend to stand down. 
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAF_01	Dawngrasp says they trust you, but I am not so sure.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAN_01	We too fought Tamsin, you know. We tried to stop her.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAO_01	You succeeded where we failed.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAP_01	You should learn some respect.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAP_03	Elements, heed my call!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeE_02	You fight with a thunder lizard. I fight with thunder itself!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeM_01	Your sister Tamsin was a hard fighter. I am sorry she lost herself to her pain.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeN_01	When Kul Tiras came for the Darkspear, my village was destroyed. My family…I lost myself too.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeO_01	There is no getting over that kind of pain, but we learn to live with the gravest wounds of the heart.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeO_02	I learned to live for the ones I lost, and to fight for those around me.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeT_01	Old Bru'kan thinks you must be the leader of these mercenaries.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeU_01	You possess great wisdom. You are calm, yet filled with determination!
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeV_01	Keep them safe, and perhaps we will find peace.
VO_Story_Hero_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9Select_01	We will come to blows if we are not careful.
VO_Story_Minion_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7Idle_01	In all my years, this be the most foolish fight I ever fought.
VO_Story_Minion_Brukan_Male_Troll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8BrukanIdle_01	I may be old, but I fight you pirates for the future.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_HeroPower_01	Light guide me.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_HeroPower_02	Behind my shield.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_HeroPower_03	Nothing to lose.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeB_Cariel_02	Not now, Scabbs. Just…focus on the battle at hand.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeC_Cariel_02	You're really worried about me. He's the one who should be worried.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5Select_01	Your burdens are mine.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeC_Cariel_01	You cannot win. Give up, pirate.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeD_Cariel_01	This is bad. What are we going to do?
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeF_Cariel_02	I'm sure she had MANY things to say.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6Select_01	Cannons? Feels like I'm back at Northwatch.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7ExchangeD_Cariel_02	Let's put an end to these distractions.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7Select_01	I cannot think of anything less paladin-like than a murloc.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeF_02	Funny…my path has never been less.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeG_02	Uh huh.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeH_02	She used to have cute nicknames for me too, like, "Loser," and "Foolish mortal."
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeH_03	And "Care." I guess she called me "Care."
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeI_02	Thank you. Guff, right? I hope you did, too.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeJ_01	I used to say I fought for the Alliance and my family. But now…I don't have any family left.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeK_01	How? How could you possibly understand?
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeL_03	I see…
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeM_02	Hmph.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeN_02	How did you get over it?
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeO_03	I think I'm beginning to understand.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9Select_01	The naaru must not fall into the wrong hands.
VO_Story_Hero_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission9_01	The pirates escaped with the shards of naaru, and our truce fractured. Frostwolf and Stormpike faced off to decide who would claim the naaru's power when all was over.
VO_Story_Minion_Cariel_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8CarielIdle_01	I have nothing to lose now. You don't want to mess with me.

VO_Story_Minion_DragonspawnDefender_Male_Dragonspawn_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Minion_DragonspawnDefender_Male_Dragonspawn_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2Play_01	For the Broodmother.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7Victory_02	The Defias Brotherhood disagrees, my good sir.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8BrukanIdle_02	I too fight for the future. Have at you!
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8CarielIdle_02	I know the strength of a person at the end of their rope.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8DawngraspIdle_02	All your knowledge, and you don't even know what secrets are right under your nose.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8EmoteResponse_01	You won't talk your way out of this one.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8ExchangeA_02	Be on your guard, Vanessa. These lapdogs can bite.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8ExchangeB_02	Mm…don't be too sure.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8ExchangeC_01	You have no idea what power the naaru offers. The shards are all here. We only lack the core.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8ExchangeD_01	Once assembled, the naaru will have the power to grant life…or destruction. Stormwind and all of Azeroth will pay for their misdeeds.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8ExchangeE_02	Go, Vanessa! Take the shards to Alterac. I'll hold them off.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8GuffIdle_02	Then join me. I need a new tauren on my crew.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8HeroPower_01	I will prevail!
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8HeroPower_02	Stand and fight!
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8HeroPower_03	I am the captain now.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8Idle_01	You may have fought through my comrades, but you won't get past me.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8Idle_02	I went through a lot of trouble to get those shards.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8Idle_03	Stormwind took what was rightfully mine. They will pay!
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8Idle_04	You can't believe all you've read about me.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8Intro_02	The Brotherhood shall prevail!
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8KurtrusIdle_02	Then you understand. Step back.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8Loss_01	Send word to Prestor and Kazakus -- the juggernaut is en route.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8RokaraIdle_02	You are too young to understand. When the Alliance takes what is yours, talk to me again about "honor."
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8TavishIdle_02	Your greed is unbecoming.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8Victory_01	This…is not the end…of the Defias!
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8XyrellaIdle_02	What of it? I fight for my daughter too.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission8_02	Lady Prestor entrusted the shards to my care. I answer only to her.
VO_Story_Hero_Edwin_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission8_04	That's right. And now I'm going to destroy you!
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission1_02	We're in a tricky spot, Cutterbutter. King's missing, Defias Brotherhood's up to something, and there are rumors of Horde agents infiltrating the city.
VO_Story_Hero_Elling_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission1_03	Shaw thinks there's a double agent in the court. One of our underworld assets has information -- an old friend of yours, if I'm not mistaken. Go meet him, and get to the bottom of this plot.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeD_02	 HEY! YOU! GUYYYYYYS!!!!!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeF_Tavish_01	Aww, look at you. So strong. So handsome.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeF_Tavish_03	Oh! I'm sure you do, but…I was…
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAH_01	You imprisoned my friend Dawngrasp.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAI_01	You are a night elf. 
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAI_03	My great uncle Hamuul is a friend of the night elves!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAJ_01	You look like you could use a warm hug.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeC_01	Hey, Rudolphus, good to see you again!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeC_03	Rudolphus, your little crustacean friend. That is how he introduced himself.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeG_01	You look just like your sister, except for the whole Forsaken eyes / dark-echo-in-her-voice thing.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeH_01	Tamsin was nice to me. She called me Funnel cake.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeI_01	Mm…Tamsin was in pain. I hope we made her feel at home.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeQ_01	You are a healer. I am a healer too!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeR_01	I heard you used a Void shard. I turned one back to Light!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeS_02	I think the Earth Mother would want me to help you.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeX_01	You should not take things that do not belong to you.
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeY_01	So you love to cook, huh? I love to eat!
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeZ_01	Are you sure you don't want to work together?
VO_Story_Hero_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9Select_01	Can't we all just get along?
VO_Story_Minion_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7Idle_01	I have cooked soup before, and that does not smell like soup.
VO_Story_Minion_Guff_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8GuffIdle_01	I do not want to hurt anyone.
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Death_01	Nooooo…
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3EmoteResponse_01	Hogger gonna get yooooooou!
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3ExchangeA_01	Hogger gonna make you pay.
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3ExchangeB_02	If no meat, Hogger no care!
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3ExchangeC_01	Heheheh HAW!
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3ExchangeD_01	Mm…meat! <_Bites_> Heheheh.
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3ExchangeE_01	Get 'em!
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3ExchangeE_02	Hogger rule this prison!
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3ExchangeE_03	<_Laughs_>
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3ExchangeF_01	Hogger gonna crush you!
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3ExchangeF_02	Ball and chain!
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3HeroPower_01	Riverpaw Pack!
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3HeroPower_02	Grrr… fresh meat!
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3HeroPower_03	More bones to gnaw on.
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Idle_01	<_Yawn_> Time for a nap.
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Idle_02	Hogger tired of waiting.
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Idle_03	Hogger gotta get outta Stormwind.
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Intro_02	Heh heh. Hogger love trouble!
VO_Story_Hero_Hogger_Male_Gnoll_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Loss_01	Hogger have biggest shadow. That why Hogger king.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_HeroPower_01	Immolate!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_HeroPower_02	I am CHAOS!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_HeroPower_03	Burn away!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeB_Kurtrus_02	Yes, working together. It felt…good. I wasn't alone anymore.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeC_Kurtrus_02	So do we.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5Select_01	Foolish goblin. I slew a dreadlord!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeC_Kurtrus_01	Together we cannot be stopped!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeD_Kurtrus_01	They swarm like demons…we must fight them.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeF_Kurtrus_02	Me? I…I don't know.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6Select_01	Move swiftly, Cutterbutter. We must not be stopped!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7ExchangeD_Kurtrus_02	Then let us turn up the heat!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7Select_01	What is this, some kind of joke?
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAG_01	You were allied with the warlock Tamsin Roame?
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAH_02	They were allied with my enemy. They deserved it.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAI_02	At some point I was.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAJ_02	Please do not touch me.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAK_01	You are allies of the warlock who summoned Anetheron.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAL_02	Clearly.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAM_02	I am not made for peace.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAN_02	And yet Anetheron still razed Stormwind.
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAO_02	Are you congratulating us or apologizing? 
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAP_02	Enough talk -- feel my fury!
VO_Story_Hero_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9Select_01	The naaru's power must be protected.
VO_Story_Minion_Kurtrus_Male_NightElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8KurtrusIdle_01	I too dedicated my life to revenge.
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	You shall pay for your insolence!
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2ExchangeA_01	Give me those letters, you little rat.
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2ExchangeB_01	Stand still and let me incinerate you!
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2ExchangeC_01	For a distraction -- which is little more than you will ever be.
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2ExchangeD_01	How do you know ancient draconic?
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2ExchangeE_01	I guess there's no point in hiding it now. Guards!
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2ExchangeF_01	No, Mister Gnome. I expect you to fry.
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2ExchangeG_01	One thing I can assure you of is your destruction. Here and now.
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2HeroPower_01	Do you expect to leave here unscathed?
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2HeroPower_02	Learn your place, mortal!
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2HeroPower_03	You dare challenge me?!
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2Idle_01	This kingdom is mine.
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2Idle_02	You cannot escape.
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2Idle_03	How did you get IN here?
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2Intro_01	Looking for something?
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2Loss_01	Ah. That was…quite pleasurable.
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2Victory_02	Not so fast.
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2Victory_03	You will be incarcerated and tried for treason! I shall watch with glee as they hand down a guilty verdict and sentence you to death by hanging.
VO_Story_Hero_Prestor_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2Victory_04	To the Stockade with you! <_Laugh_>
VO_Story_Hero_Smite_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Smite_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6EmoteResponse_01	You there, check out that noise!
VO_Story_Hero_Smite_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeA_02	Don't let them through!
VO_Story_Hero_Smite_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeB_01	You Alliance types are tougher than I thought. I'll have to improvise.
VO_Story_Hero_Smite_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeC_01	<_Laughs_>
VO_Story_Hero_Smite_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeG_01	D'ah! Now you're making me angry!
VO_Story_Hero_Smite_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6HeroPower_01	Cannonball!
VO_Story_Hero_Smite_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6HeroPower_02	Bombs away!
VO_Story_Hero_Smite_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6HeroPower_03	Smite you!
VO_Story_Hero_Smite_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6Idle_01	I'll cleave through the lot of you.
VO_Story_Hero_Smite_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6Idle_02	You better not stand still when the cannonballs fly.
VO_Story_Hero_Smite_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6Idle_03	You know why they call me Mr. Smite?
VO_Story_Hero_Smite_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6Intro_02	We're under attack! Avast, ye swabs! Repel the invaders!
VO_Story_Hero_Smite_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6Loss_01	Finished. Tell Captain Greenskin we are clear to depart.
VO_Story_Hero_Smite_Male_Tauren_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission6_03	FIRE!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeF_Cariel_01	You're Tamsin's sister. She talked a lot about you.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeF_Cariel_03	They weren't all bad! I-I swear!
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeA_02	That's true, but only if you scratch out "Alliance" and replace it with "Horde!" We can't trust you.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAG_02	Horde is family, no matter what you look like. That is the third lesson.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeB_02	Ha! Good luck with that.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeF_01	It's you and me -- orc versus human. My path has never been more clear.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeP_01	You wield a shard. I have seen them do terrible things to people.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeW_01	You were a cook? Thank goodness! I'm starving.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9Intro_02	So you can use it to slay more Frostwolves? I don't think so.
VO_Story_Hero_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9Victory_Tavish_01	Quick, while they're recovering. We have to hurry after the naaru. Let's go.
VO_Story_Minion_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7Idle_01	This cook makes a mockery of combat.
VO_Story_Minion_Rokara_Female_Orc_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8RokaraIdle_01	You are a thief and saboteur. You have no honor.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_BOMSelect_01	There's a traitor in the Stormwind court, and Agent Cutterbutter will get to the bottom of it.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1ExchangeA_02	How goes retirement, Bob?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1ExchangeB_01	What's the story with the mole in the Stormwind court? Waddaya got for me?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1ExchangeC_01	Where d'ya get all these bruisers from? Some kind of underground fight club?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Intro_02	Bob, it's me, Scabbs. Don'cha recognize me?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Victory_02	They're shards of a broken naaru -- some kind of energy being. I was sent to collect one in the Barrens.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission1Victory_04	You think Prestor is the mole.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2ExchangeA_01	No, I think I'll read them. Who's this VanCleef guy? And what's he got to do with the naaru?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2ExchangeB_01	This letter's addressed to Kazakus. That troll from Dreadmist Peak? You two are working together? But he's with the Horde!
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2ExchangeC_01	A letter to Tamsin Roame. You're helping the Horde sneak into Stormwind. Why?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2ExchangeD_01	What?! This letter is written in ancient draconic.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2ExchangeE_01	I knew you were bad, but this -- this is a -- you're a…
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2ExchangeF_01	So Lady Prestor, do you expect me to talk?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2Intro_01	This is it! The proof I need.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission2Victory_01	Whew. Time to get out of here.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3ExchangeA_02	Pay? For what?!
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3ExchangeB_01	I have information vital to the Alliance, so back off!
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3ExchangeG_01	Not looking good…
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3ExchangeI_01	You're that mage we locked up. Dawngrasp.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3ExchangeJ_01	You were working with Kazakus. He's in league with Lady Prestor. She's trying to smuggle the shards of naaru out of Stormwind.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Intro_01	I don't want trouble. I'm just looking for a way out of here.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Victory_01	You really saved my mustache. Thanks.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Victory_03	Horde and Alliance teaming up to take on a bigger threat? When would THAT ever happen?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4ExchangeD_02	Why are you helping me?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4ExchangeE_02	I'm handling the locks and fighting the guards. What are you doing?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4ExchangeF_01	Hey, Dawngrasp, you go by "they." 
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4ExchangeF_03	Oh. Okay!
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Idle_01	I'll have this open in short order.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Idle_02	Combination locks, eh?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Idle_03	No bars can hold Scabbs!
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Idle_04	There are only so many combinations, right?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Intro_01	I'll have us out of here in no time.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4IntroAlt_01	C'mon, we're busting outta here.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Victory_02	You could have done that the WHOLE TIME?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeA_02	Let's sink this scoundrel.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeB_Cariel_01	How are you holding up, Cariel?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeB_Kurtrus_01	Did you really take down a dreadlord?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeB_Tavish_01	Can't you shoot any faster? Or is it too hard to aim with that furbolg hanging off your chin?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeB_Xyrella_01	Xyrella! You seem…different.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeC_Cariel_01	Stay focused now. This goblin is tricky.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeC_Kurtrus_01	I wish I could have been there to take a crack at fighting Anetheron.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeC_Tavish_02	Was that a feeble attempt at saying something nice?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeC_Xyrella_02	Yeah, but…after you cook the meal, you still gotta clean the kitchen.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeD_01	We're gonna run your little toy boat aground.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeD_03	That was only THREE TIMES!
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5Intro_01	Prestor's letters said that the shards of naaru would be brought through these mines.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5Victory_02	We did it! Now to find where they've hidden the shards.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5Victory_04	Tavish, wait!
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeA_01	The shards of naaru must be aboard that juggernaut. We gotta get past these cannons…and HIM.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeE_01	You came to help us?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6Intro_01	A pirate ship! In the middle of the Deadmines.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6Victory_01	We did it! All together. Who woulda thought?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7ExchangeA_01	Fish food, huh? Well I got a bouillabaisse with your name written all over it.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7ExchangeB_02	Hey! Nobody calls ME shrimp.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7ExchangeC_02	Chefs don't talk to chefs like that! This thing has ZERO etiquette. 
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7ExchangeD_01	I'm getting real fed up with this thing.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7Intro_01	All right, fishface, get out of the cauldron and put down the spoon.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7Victory_01	Hey look, the shards! We got them at last.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8ExchangeB_01	When we fight together, you don't stand a chance.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8Intro_01	Ready, everyone? Let's get him!
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8Victory_02	We cleared the Deadmines, but a small group of Defias escaped with the shards, leaving us all standing around like we were waiting for a table at an inn.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAA_02	What about your orc?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAB_03	I know, I know. Blast it.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAC_01	Let the Alliance keep the naaru once it's all over. You can trust us.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAD_02	Scabbs Cutterbutter at your service.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAE_02	Why don't you ask your Frostwolf the same thing?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAF_02	I'd go with your instincts on this one, Grandpa.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeW_02	Take this seriously!
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeX_02	You shouldn't stand there blocking out the sun!
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeY_02	Do other intelligence agents deal with this?
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeZ_02	The dwarf may be annoying, but we have each other's back. Nothing can change that.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9Select_01	We can't let them get their hands on the naaru.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission1_01	Xyrella, Tavish, and I returned to Stormwind, and I reported to SI:7 Headquarters, ready for my next assignment.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission2_01	Lady Prestor was the most powerful human in Stormwind. She had Highlord Fordragon and the royal family wrapped around her little finger.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission2_02	If there was evidence of her treachery to be found, it would be in the most secure room in the most secure castle in the most secure city in all of Azeroth.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission2_03	Breaking in would be a nearly impossible task -- but not for Scabbs Cutterbutter!
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission3_01	The Stormwind Stockade was a cold, dark place, filled with the most unsavory  baddies. Imprisoned, I had to cook up an escape.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission3_02	Unfortunately, one of my fellow inmates was determined to make an example of me.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission4_01	I caught Dawngrasp up on what I'd found in Lady Prestor's chambers, and immediately they seemed invigorated by the news.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission4_03	Clearly you don't know me very well. Watch this!
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission5_01	When we emerged from the Stockade, Stormwind was in shambles. The dreadlord Anetheron was slain, but at great cost. 
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission5_02	Dawngrasp went to meet up with their friends, and I rallied my own companions for an intercept mission to the Deadmines.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission6_01	The doors opened onto a vast subterranean lake. Piers crisscrossed over the water. Cannonballs and angry parrots flew about our heads!
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission6_02	And at the center of it all, an enormous juggernaut, its massive smokestack scraping the stalactites above.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission7_01	In SI:7, we'd been trained to hate the Horde. But these mercenaries seemed all right.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission7_02	We fought through lines of Defias fighters, to the upper deck, until we found ourselves face to flipper with a dangerous adversary. It was…a cook! Like me!
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission8_01	Edwin VanCleef, leader of the Defias Brotherhood, I'm putting you under arrest by the authority of Stormwind Intelligence.
VO_Story_Hero_Scabbs_Male_Gnome_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission8_03	Lady Prestor tried to have Stormwind destroyed!
VO_Story_Hero_Sneed_Male_Goblin_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Sneed_Male_Goblin_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5EmoteResponse_01	Sorry, I can't hear ya over all this high tech heavy machinery.
VO_Story_Hero_Sneed_Male_Goblin_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeA_01	Hoist the mainsail! Engage rocket boosters! Fire the laser beams!
VO_Story_Hero_Sneed_Male_Goblin_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeD_02	Hehe! Try saying that five times fast. Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
VO_Story_Hero_Sneed_Male_Goblin_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5HeroPower_01	Anchors away!
VO_Story_Hero_Sneed_Male_Goblin_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5HeroPower_02	There she blows!
VO_Story_Hero_Sneed_Male_Goblin_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5HeroPower_03	What the hull?
VO_Story_Hero_Sneed_Male_Goblin_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5HeroPower_04	Come sail away!
VO_Story_Hero_Sneed_Male_Goblin_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5Idle_01	Ah, the wind in my hair, exhaust fumes in my nose…
VO_Story_Hero_Sneed_Male_Goblin_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5Idle_02	Look lively, landlubbers.
VO_Story_Hero_Sneed_Male_Goblin_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5Idle_03	I'd rather be sailing. Wait -- I am sailing!
VO_Story_Hero_Sneed_Male_Goblin_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5Intro_02	Intruders! Time to take the Sailmaster 9000 for a test drive.
VO_Story_Hero_Sneed_Male_Goblin_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5Loss_01	Good work, Sneed. Another successful 3000 IQ invention.
VO_Story_Hero_Sneed_Male_Goblin_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5Victory_01	Uh oh! Goblin overboard!
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_HeroPower_01	Watch how it's done.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_HeroPower_02	You show 'em, Crabby!
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_HeroPower_03	Haha!
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeB_Tavish_02	Aren't rogues supposed ta be SILENT?
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeC_Tavish_01	Ye seem stronger, Cutterbutter. Maybe prison suited ye.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeC_Tavish_03	Aye. You stayin' in prison would be very nice.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5Select_01	Don't stand in front of my bullets.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5Victory_03	I wonder what's behind these big doors. Maybe it's loot!
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeC_Tavish_01	Aww, ye almost sound scared. Time ta grab this bull by the horns!
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeD_Tavish_01	Ach, bloody pirates. How will we get out of this one?
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeF_Tavish_02	Tha's kind of ye ta notice, tauren. I work hard to stay in prime physical condition.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeF_Tavish_04	You were talkin' to my battle crab. I know. I know.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6Select_01	Now THOSE are some huge guns.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7ExchangeD_Tavish_02	End it then! But I'm keepin' the spoon as a memento. 
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7Select_01	Don't worry, Crabby. You won't end up in the stew.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8Victory_03	VanCleef said the shards were goin' ta Alterac Valley. I know it well. If we take the Deeprun Tram, we might be able to beat them there.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeA_01	The Alliance'll retrieve the naaru and stop Kazakus and Prestor. We donnae need yer help. 
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeB_01	You best watch yerself. We will fight to keep ye from takin' it.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeC_02	Who are ya talkin' to, tauren?
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeC_04	His name is Crabby!
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeD_01	You worked with Kazakus, blood elf. I'd lock you up again.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeE_01	Keep your elements away from me, shaman.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9Intro_01	Go back to Orgrimmar, little orc. We'll handle the naaru from here.
VO_Story_Hero_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9Victory_Rokara_01	And stay down. We'll handle the naaru ourselves.
VO_Story_Minion_Tavish_Male_Dwarf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8TavishIdle_01	This is the most important loot I ever fought for. I won't give up now.
VO_Story_Hero_Thelwater_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4BossInactive_01	Keep it down.
VO_Story_Hero_Thelwater_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4BossInactive_02	Stay out of trouble.
VO_Story_Hero_Thelwater_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4BossInactive_03	Hmph.
VO_Story_Hero_Thelwater_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Hero_Thelwater_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4EmoteResponse_01	I don't want to hear another peep out of you two.
VO_Story_Hero_Thelwater_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4ExchangeAAlt_01	You'll never escape.
VO_Story_Hero_Thelwater_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4HeroPower_01	Quiet in there!
VO_Story_Hero_Thelwater_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4HeroPower_02	Just what are you up to?
VO_Story_Hero_Thelwater_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4HeroPower_03	Silence, prisoners!
VO_Story_Hero_Thelwater_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4HeroPower_04	Last warning.
VO_Story_Hero_Thelwater_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Idle_01	Now it's too quiet.
VO_Story_Hero_Thelwater_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Idle_02	Those prisoners are up to something. I'm sure of it.
VO_Story_Hero_Thelwater_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Idle_03	Maybe I'm the one who's really in prison.
VO_Story_Hero_Thelwater_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Intro_02	Silence, prisoner! I'm watching you. 
VO_Story_Hero_Thelwater_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4IntroAlt_02	Halt!
VO_Story_Hero_Thelwater_Male_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Loss_01	That's it. I'm putting you in solitary.
VO_Story_Hero_Vanessa_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8ExchangeA_01	If you want to face my father, you'll have to go through me.
VO_Story_Hero_Vanessa_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8ExchangeE_01	I'm sorry, Father. They are too powerful.
VO_Story_Minion_Vanessa_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8Attack_01	Send my regards!
VO_Story_Minion_Vanessa_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8Death_01	<_death_>
VO_Story_Minion_Vanessa_Female_Human_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8Play_01	Nobody cross the Uncrowned!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3ExchangeH_01	Unhand that gnome! Face me, you fiend!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3ExchangeI_02	Are you going to talk, or help me fight this freakishly powerful gnoll?
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3ExchangeJ_02	I went to the Barrens to spy on Kazakus. That's why I was with him.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3ExchangeJ_03	The naaru can grant immense power. If it fell into the wrong hands, it would spell disaster for Azeroth.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Victory_02	We need to work together if we're going to escape this prison.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4BossActive_01	Stay in the shadows.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4BossActive_02	Look out, the warden is coming.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4BossActive_03	Here is the warden. Stay quiet, Scabbs.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4BossInactive_04	He is gone. Now, back to the locks.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4BossInactive_05	The warden departs. Let us continue.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4CorrectCombo_01	You did it!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4CorrectCombo_02	Good work, Scabbs.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4CorrectCombo_03	Your lockpicking skills are impressive.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4CorrectCombo_04	The lock is open.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4CorrectCombo_05	We are almost free. I can feel it!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4ExchangeA_01	Be careful, Scabbs. Do not let the warden see you.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4ExchangeA_02	You have to hit the locks in the correct order to open them.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4ExchangeAAlt_02	I will handle this.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4ExchangeB_01	A lock! Scabbs, can you break it?
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4ExchangeC_01	Another lock.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4ExchangeD_01	Another lock…this one looks trickier.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4ExchangeD_03	We are both misfits. It seems only proper that we work together.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4ExchangeE_01	Silence those guards, Scabbs. Do it, you know, silently.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4ExchangeE_03	Providing intellectual guidance. And moral support. And color commentary.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4ExchangeF_02	That's right. I simply do not use "he" or "she."
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Guards_01	Guards! Handle them, Scabbs.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Guards_02	A patrol. Take care of them.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Idle_01	I find your dexterity positively fascinating.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Idle_02	Go on, then. Show me how it's done.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Idle_03	Make sure you hold the rake pick steady.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Idle_04	How many tumblers on this one? Sorry, I'll be quiet.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4Victory_01	That's it! You have done it. Now we can escape. 
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4WrongCombo_01	Something went wrong.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4WrongCombo_02	That is not it.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4WrongCombo_03	Try again.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4WrongCombo_04	I am sure you are close.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission4WrongCombo_05	Hmm…maybe less bragging next time.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeD_03	Looks like you could use some help. After the shards of naaru, are we?
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeE_02	One band of misfits helps another. Is that not how this works?
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeF_Xyrella_01	I apologize profusely for our altercation on Dreadmist Peak. I intended to catalog Kazakus's movements, but was caught up in his shameful activities.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeF_Xyrella_03	The naaru! Yes!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6Victory_02	It looks like the juggernaut is preparing to depart. We must retrieve the shards before it's too late.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAA_01	Scabbs, you know me. Call off your allies. We must not fight.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAA_03	What about your dwarf?
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAB_01	You know what Prestor is capable of. I know Kazakus's wicked heart.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAB_01	They are up to something bad. And big. We must end them.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAC_02	Scabbs…you know we cannot do that.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAK_02	Yes, well, it's…complicated.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAL_01	We traveled together, but Tamsin had her own agenda.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeAM_01	I do not see any reason why we cannot fight together.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeD_02	I am actually quite nice!
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeJ_02	I know what you mean.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeK_02	I put my trust in my teacher, Prince Kael'thas. He betrayed our people.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeK_03	They were suspicious; they thought I was part of his plot.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeL_01	I lost my teacher. I lost my people, my country. I was lost.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeL_02	But I found a new family, with these friends. 
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9Select_01	I need to think. There must be a solution to this schism.
VO_Story_Hero_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_PreMission4_02	They plan to smuggle the shards of naaru out through the Deadmines. We must tell our comrades and intercept the shipment. Can you unlock our cell door?
VO_Story_Minion_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Attack_01	Face my flame!
VO_Story_Minion_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Attack_02	For Silvermoon!
VO_Story_Minion_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Death_01	<_Death_>
VO_Story_Minion_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Play_01	I'll find a way out of here.
VO_Story_Minion_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Trigger_01	Fired up!
VO_Story_Minion_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Trigger_02	Burn bright!
VO_Story_Minion_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Trigger_03	You are torched.
VO_Story_Minion_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Trigger_04	I have made fire!
VO_Story_Minion_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission3Trigger_05	Gnolls are highly flammable.
VO_Story_Minion_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7Idle_01	The Defias's attempts to domesticate this murloc appear to have been only marginally effective.
VO_Story_Minion_Dawngrasp_X_BloodElf_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8DawngraspIdle_01	The probability of your success is approaching zero. The prudent thing to do would be surrender. 
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_HeroPower_01	Shadow comes!
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_HeroPower_02	By the naaru's power…
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_HeroPower_03	Hear my prayer.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeB_Xyrella_02	The naaru are a marriage of Light and Shadow, as am I. 
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5ExchangeC_Xyrella_01	We will find what we seek. No sacrifice is too great.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission5Select_01	We must find the shards.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeC_Xyrella_01	Now we have him. Push forward!
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeD_Xyrella_01	No…I can try…to heal us…
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6ExchangeF_Xyrella_02	What matters now is that we fight together -- to save the fractured naaru.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission6Select_01	I can feel it -- on that ship -- shards of naaru…dozens of them!
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7ExchangeD_Xyrella_02	This murloc distracts us from our task. Let us be swift.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission7Select_01	The chefs aboard the Exodar were much more refined.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8Victory_04	I sense we are near the end of our journey. I am afraid of what is to come, but now is the time to be strong. Now is the time to fight.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeP_02	In the Light's name, the shards must be used to heal.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeQ_02	Sir, I am trying to fight you.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeR_02	What? How!
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeS_01	Please, show me how to restore the naaru. I must save my daughter.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeT_02	Me? Why would you assume such a thing?
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeU_02	Are you trying to flatter me in the middle of combat?
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9ExchangeV_02	The naaru's Light will bring peace.
VO_Story_Hero_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission9Select_01	Without care, the naaru could turn Void.
VO_Story_Minion_Xyrella_Female_Draenei_BOM_Scabbs_Mission8XyrellaIdle_01	Stay out of my way. I fight for my daughter.

#BOM Tavish
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_Emote_Picked_01	I'm Tavish Stormpike, and nobody's comin' between me and my loot!
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_01_01_A	You'd think it'd be enough to save Stormwind from a demon army and demolish the Defias gang, but no. A handful of pirates escaped the Deadmines and took the shards of naaru with 'em!
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_01_01_B	The documents I found in Lady Prestor's chamber showed the pirates planned to bring the shards of naaru to Alterac Valley. Our Alliance has a big presence there, led by Vanndar Stormpike. Do you know him, Tavish?
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_01_01_C	Of course I know 'im, ya cannonball-headed clunker! He's my cousin, and about as pleasant as a murloc.
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_Introduction_01_A	Well, well, well. If it isn't old Tavish, come back to the Stormpikes at last. Rob any tombs lately, you undignified kobold?
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Introduction_01_B	Why I oughta wring your hairy old neck!
VO_BOM_08_001_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_Turn_01_01_A	Tavish, please. You must make amends. We need his help.
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_Turn_01_01_B	That's right. If you're rejoinin' the clan, you better prove yourself to me in battle!
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_03_01_A	If yer askin' for a fight, yer gonna get it. I've always wanted ta knock ya on yer rear end.
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_Turn_03_01_B	And I've always wanted to teach you some manners, boy.
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_Turn_07_01_A	You swore never to return to the Stormpikes. I should've known that would be another broken promise.
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_07_01_B	There's bigger things happenin' now.
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_11_01_A	Lady Prestor is a traitor to the Alliance. She's tryin' to corrupt a naaru here in Alterac.
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_11_01_B	She wants to use the naaru as a weapon, and the Horde's after it for themselves!
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_Turn_13_01_A	The power of a naaru...it could end the battle of Alterac Valley! 
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_A	It looks like your beard's grown a bit since you left us, Tavish. All right, we'll help you get this naaru.
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_B	But first...you're gonna help me.
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	I knew you'd come crawlin' back one day.
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_BossDeath_01	[REUSE]
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	Your attacks are weak! Go practice on some rabbits and come back when you're stronger.
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_BossIdle_01	The Frostwolves are crafty foes. We can't let 'em get the better of us.
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_BossIdle_02	Quit countin' yer loot and fight me, Tavish.
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_BossIdle_03	You've gathered a rather odd party of misfits, cousin.
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	Glory for the Stormpikes!
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	Take no prisoners!
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	Ha ha!
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_02_01_A	Irondeep Mine has resources vital to the war effort, but the mine's overrun with Troggs. If you want my help, get in there and root them out.
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_02_01_B	The snowy cliffs of Alterac Valley were cold and clear. There was an almost stark beauty to the place. 
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_02_01_C	With Xyrella, Cariel, Kurtrus, and Cutterbutter beside me, we struck out for the mine, our boots leaving trails of black craters behind us.
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Introduction_01_A	This mine stinks. Why does it stink?
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Trogg_Morloch_InGame_Introduction_01_B	We TROGGS, stupid!
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Introduction_01_C	Oh, that's why it stinks.
VO_BOM_08_002_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_HE_Custom_BOM_08_Boss_02HPSelect_01_01	Stay strong, Tavish. We have faced foul creatures before.
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_NightElf_Kurtrus_InGame_HE_Custom_BOM_08_Boss_02 HPSelect_02_01	Take aim, Tavish. We will make short work of them.
VO_BOM_08_002_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_Turn_03_01_A	Ever since we entered the valley, the cries of the naaru have gotten louder. I can feel its suffering.
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_03_01_B	It's all right. With the Stormpikes' help, we'll get that naaru and save your daughter.
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_Turn_07_01_A	The Stormpikes sure are rich. I always wondered why you were so desperate and loot-hungry, Tavish.
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_07_01_B	You should know every Stormpike isn't rich, Cutterbutter. Just like I know not every gnome is a thieving saddle sore like you!
VO_BOM_08_002_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_Turn_11_01_A	Scabbs, be careful. These troggs are dangerous foes.
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_Turn_11_01_B	Thanks, I know, Mom. Gah! I mean, Xyrella! I'll keep my guard up.
VO_BOM_08_002_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_Turn_03_01_A	We must reclaim the naaru from Lady Prestor. She instigated Tamsin's attack on Stormwind.
VO_BOM_08_002_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_Turn_03_01_B	I shudder to think what she could accomplish with that much power.
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_07_01_A	I never did properly thank ya for helpin' me back in Stormwind. You saved a lot of good dwarves that day.
VO_BOM_08_002_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_Turn_07_01_B	Stormwind is my home, and I was responsible...for Tamsin...
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_NightElf_Kurtrus_InGame_Turn_11_01_A	Cariel -- I will be by your side until the bitter end. Prestor must pay for her role in Anetheron's return.
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_NightElf_Kurtrus_InGame_Turn_11_01_B	But the path to vengeance is a thick and twisted wood. Do not become lost...as I did.
VO_BOM_08_002_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_Turn_11_01_C	Thank you, Kurtrus. I understand.
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_A	That's the last of 'em. Let's hope Vanndar follows through on his end of the bargain.
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Trogg_Morloch_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	You talk, I get stronger!
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Trogg_Morloch_InGame_BossDeath_01	<_Death_>
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Trogg_Morloch_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	Maybe Frostwolves come next time. Ha, ha, ha.
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Trogg_Morloch_InGame_BossIdle_01	This trogg mine!
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Trogg_Morloch_InGame_BossIdle_02	Mine is mine!
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Trogg_Morloch_InGame_BossIdle_03	Why dwarves hammer all day long?
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Trogg_Morloch_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	Every-trogg, get in here!
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Trogg_Morloch_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	More troggs!
VO_BOM_08_002_Male_Trogg_Morloch_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	Trogg Day Afternoon!
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_03_01_A	With the mine secure, we started back to the Stormpikes. On our way, four figures approached us through the snow. 
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_03_01_B	I should've known the Horde would show up.
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_03_01_C	Bru'kan, look! It's that Stormpike and his allies. Frostwolves, attack!
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Introduction_01_A	Step aside, orc. This is Stormpike territory.
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_Introduction_01_B	Everything the snow touches belongs to the Frostwolves. I was born in this valley. No Stormpike can say the same!
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_HE_Custom_BOM_08_Xyrella_03t_Play_01	When brought together, the naaru can heal...or destroy.
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_HE_Custom_BOM_08_Cariel_03t_Play_01	Trust in the Alliance. We will save the naaru.
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_NightElf_Kurtrus_InGame_HE_Custom_BOM_08_Kurtrus_03t_Play_01	I will not give up. You should know that by now.
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_HE_Custom_BOM_08_Scabbs_03t_Play_01	Lady Prestor is behind all this. She's the one we should be fighting.
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_BOM_08_Brukan_03t_Play_01	These be my friends. You will not harm them!
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_HE_Custom_BOM_08_Guff_03t_Play_01	Stop fighting! No loud noises!
VO_BOM_08_003_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_HE_Custom_BOM_08_Dawngrasp_03t_Play_01	Where is Scabbs? My friend, tell them we are on the same side.
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_Turn_03_01_A	Leave this land, Stormpike. As long as the naaru is in Alterac, it is our responsibility.
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_03_01_B	You snuck a warlock into Stormwind who summoned a dreadlord! Excuse me if the Alliance is better equipped to handle this than you!
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_Turn_07_01_A	The Stormpikes trespass in this land. Get out.
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_07_01_B	The Stormpikes are searching for ancient titan artifacts that can teach us the origins of our people!
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_07_01_C	There isn't any better loot than that.
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_Turn_11_01_A	We have information you don't. Frostwolf scouts spotted Kazakus in Alterac. He's working with Prestor, turning the naaru to the Void.
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_11_01_B	Well now we DO have that information. We already fought Kazakus once. You worked with him!
VO_BOM_08_003_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_HE_Custom_If_ScabbsDawngrasp_InPlay_01_A	Cook up anything nice lately, Scabbs?
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_HE_Custom_If_ScabbsDawngrasp_InPlay_01_B	The only thing I've been cooking up is trouble. Ha!
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_HE_Custom_If_CarielBrukan_InPlay_01_A	You there, shaman. When last we met you spoke of my sister. Tell me…what do you remember of her?
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_If_CarielBrukan_InPlay_01_B	She was fiercely competitive…driven by her fears. Once, she freed me from the jaws of a giant threshadon, the great Isha Awak!
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_If_CarielBrukan_InPlay_01_C	In battle she was relentless...even when she was afraid.
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_HE_Custom_If_GuffCrabby_InPlay_01_A	Rudolphus! Hey, buddy. Are you taking care of your pal Tavish?
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_HE_Custom_If_GuffCrabby_InPlay_01_B	Keep your snout away from my crab!
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_HE_Custom_If_GuffCrabby_InPlay_01_C	He says you need to eat more vegetables.
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_HE_Custom_IfRokaraPlaysPup_01	Go get 'em, boy!
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Troll_Brukan_inGame_Victory_PreExplosion_01_A	Enough! Let them go, Rokara.
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_Victory_PreExplosion_01_B	This isn't over, Stormpike. Our weapons will cross on the Field of Strife.
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_Victory_PreExplosion_01_C	Bye!
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	Don't forget, we saved you in the Deadmines.
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_BossDeath_01	[Reuse]
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	I'm sorry. But I promise we will use the naaru with honor.
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_BossIdle_01	I grew up here, you know.
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_BossIdle_02	So what if you've got a gun? I've got two guns right here, baby.
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_BossIdle_03	I hate snow. It's cold, and wet, and irritating, and it gets everywhere.
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	What happens when an unstoppable force meets and immovable object?
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	I'll take you head on!
VO_BOM_08_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	Unstoppable!
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_04_01_A	I hate to say it, Tavish, but I'm impressed. And while you were gone, my gryphon scouts found where the naaru is being reassembled. The problem is there's a Frostwolf army between us and it. 
VO_BOM_08_001_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_04_01_B	Get some rest, cousin. Our axes will get much use on the morrow.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_04_01_C	My party made camp and lit a fire. Some hot food and warm company would do us well before the cold battle to come. 
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Introduction_01	The fire's lit. Now to roast us up some vittles.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_Turn_01_01_A	Hey, I'm the chef. I should be the one to cook.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_01_01_B	You are guests of the Stormpikes, Cutterbutter. I'll be cookin'. Now what'll it be?
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_Turn_01_01_C	Just make me something plain. Less likely to get food poisoning that way.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_HE_Custom_IfScabbsFail_01	How do you mess up something that plain? Try again.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_HE_Custom_IfScabbsSuccess_01_A	I hate to admit it, but this is pretty good.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_HE_Custom_IfScabbsSuccess_01_B	We might not always see eye to eye, but I'm with you until the end. I'd give my life to help Xyrella save her kid.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_HE_Custom_IfScabbsSuccess_01_C	So would I.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_03_01_A	What can I get ya, Cariel?
VO_BOM_08_004_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_Turn_03_01_B	I'm not really hungry.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_03_01_C	Something simple then. You need your strength to lift that oversized hammer.
VO_BOM_08_004_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_HE_Custom_IfCarielFail_01	You know what? It's fine. I wasn't hungry anyway.
VO_BOM_08_004_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_HE_Custom_IfCarielSucceed_01_A	What a meal! Maybe I was hungry.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_HE_Custom_IfCarielSucceed_01_B	Like I said, you'll need your strength.
VO_BOM_08_004_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_HE_Custom_IfCarielSucceed_01_C	After all our battles, after all we have learned, I have watched our party gain so much power. And yet…
VO_BOM_08_004_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_HE_Custom_IfCarielSucceed_01_D	…For all our strength, I feel powerless. More now than ever.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_05_01_A	Kurtrus Ashfallen! If it isn't our walking Gnomish Army Knife. Interest ya'n a pint?
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_NightElf_Kurtrus_InGame_Turn_05_01_B	Tonight I will feast. Tomorrow my glaives will feast on our enemies!
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_NightElf_Kurtrus_InGame_HE_Custom_IfKurtrusFail_01	I expected more from you, Tavish. Now I am hungry AND disappointed.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_NightElf_Kurtrus_InGame_HE_Custom_IfKurtrusSucceed_01_A	This is delicious! I will eat all of it!
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_HE_Custom_IfKurtrusSucceed_01_B	How are ya? You've been quiet ever since Anetheron was slain.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_NightElf_Kurtrus_InGame_HE_Custom_IfKurtrusSucceed_01_C	For countless nights I imagined my triumph over Anetheron.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_NightElf_Kurtrus_InGame_HE_Custom_IfKurtrusSucceed_01_D	Never in my dreams did I assume I would survive the exchange.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_NightElf_Kurtrus_InGame_HE_Custom_IfKurtrusSucceed_01_E	Now that I have…I know not what to do. Go back to Illidan?
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_NightElf_Kurtrus_InGame_HE_Custom_IfKurtrusSucceed_01_F	I care for my comrades in Outland, but you four feel more like family than they ever did.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_07_01_A	Xyrella, let me fix you something special.
VO_BOM_08_004_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_Turn_07_01_B	Please, Tavish, do not trouble yourself.
VO_BOM_08_004_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_HE_Custom_IfXyrellaFail_01	Worry not. You tried your best.
VO_BOM_08_004_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_HE_Custom_IfXyrellaSucceed_01_A	You have outdone yourself, Tavish. This is quite…scrumptious!
VO_BOM_08_004_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_HE_Custom_IfXyrellaSucceed_01_B	Hmm...On nights like this, when the stars shine and the world is quiet, I feel my child's love deep within me.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_HE_Custom_IfXyrellaSucceed_01_C	You'll be with her soon. But tomorrow, you'll need strength.
VO_BOM_08_004_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_HE_Custom_IfXyrellaSucceed_01_D	Love is all the strength I need. Mine is unbreakable. You will see.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Victory_PreExplosion_01_A	It's late. Tomorrow will be a trying day…maybe the last some of us ever see. Get some rest.
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_01_A	At dawn, the gates opened and Stormpike forces charged down into the valley.
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_01_B	We led our army onto the Field of Strife, a burnt and cratered basin where we met the enemy head on.
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Introduction_05_01_A	Let us through!
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Orc_Galvangar_InGame_Introduction_05_01_B	I fight for Drek'Thar! For the Frostwolves!
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_01_01_A	Cariel, hold the left flank. Xyrella, lead Kurtrus on the right. I'll take center.
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_Turn_01_01_B	So will I. You need all the help you can get, dwarf.
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_HE_Custom_FirstTimeScabbsDies_01	Get up, you old lazy cutpurse. There's a war on!
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_HE_Custom_FirstTimeScabbsRez_01	Looks like all that time filleting fish comes in handy once in a while.
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_HE_Custom_FirstTimeTavishKills_01	Wowee! What a shot!
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_HE_Custom_FirstTimeTavishPlaysTrap_01	Guess I'm not the only one who's sneaky.
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_07_01_A	Watch your feet, Cutterbutter. The snow can be quite treacherous.
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_Turn_07_01_B	I like fighting in the snow. Reminds me of my early days back in Dun Morogh.
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_07_01_C	I spent my early days as a merc in Dun Morogh!
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_09_01_A	Back in Dun Morogh, you ever try the boar ribs at Thunderbrew Distillery? Best ribs I ever had.
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_Turn_09_01_B	Are you kidding? I can taste them now!
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_Turn_09_01_C	One time I tried to make 'em myself. Ended up with a raging singular of crag boars chasing me halfway to Loch Modan!
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_13_01_A	Watch your back.
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_Turn_13_01_B	Is that a threat? Assassins and backs have kind of a strange relationship.
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_13_01_C	It's a dwarven saying. It means "Take care."
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_HE_Custom_FirstTimeBossAt10Health_01_A	For the Stormpikes!
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_HE_Custom_FirstTimeBossAt10Health_01_B	For Gnomeregan!
VO_BOM_08_005_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_Victory_PostExplosion_01_A	Tavish! We just received word. Stonehearth Outpost has fallen.
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Victory_PostExplosion_01_B	They tricked us! This fight was just a diversion. Fall back, troops! We must defend the bridge!
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Orc_Galvangar_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	Do you two ever stop TALKING!?
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Orc_Galvangar_InGame_BossDeath_01	<_death_>
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Orc_Galvangar_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	Press forward, Frostwolves. Their general awaits!
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Orc_Galvangar_InGame_BossIdle_01	Mm...daboo...
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Orc_Galvangar_InGame_BossIdle_02	Do you hear the clash of iron?
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Orc_Galvangar_InGame_BossIdle_03	The Frostwolves will fight to the last orc.
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Orc_Galvangar_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	For honor!
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Orc_Galvangar_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	Honor guide me.
VO_BOM_08_005_Male_Orc_Galvangar_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	Strength and honor!
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_06_01_A	Our troops retreated to Dun Baldar, Vanndar's base of operations, before the Frostwolves came down on us like a cave-in in a mine.
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_06_01_B	A narrow bridge spanned a deep ravine that separated us from the enemy. But with our forces broken, we didn't have the troops to defend the bridge. Except...
VO_BOM_08_002_Female_Human_Cariel_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_06_01_C	You have me. I will hold the bridge. Take out as many of them as you can from a distance. I promise. No one will get through.
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Introduction_01_A	Go back where ya came from, Frostwolf!
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Orc_DrekThar_InGame_Introduction_01_B	This is where we came from, Stormpike.
VO_BOM_08_006_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_Turn_01_01_A	I'm in position. I'm ready.
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Orc_DrekThar_InGame_Turn_01_01_B	You will fall to my champions.
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Orc_DrekThar_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterChampionFalls_01_01_A	What is taking so long? Call in air support.
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterChampionFalls_01_01_B	I don't see Rokara among their forces.
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Orc_DrekThar_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterChampionFalls_01_01_C	She and her companions have their own mission. Ours is to rid this valley of you.
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterChampionFalls_02_01_A	Cariel, are you all right?
VO_BOM_08_006_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterChampionFalls_02_01_B	My shield will not waver. For the Alliance!
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Orc_DrekThar_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterChampionFalls_03_01_A	No matter. Lieutenant Grummus will pull you from this bridge!
VO_BOM_08_006_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterChampionFalls_03_01_B	I could do this all weekend.
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Undead_Grummus_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterChampionFalls_04_01_A	No-o-o-o!
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterChampionFalls_04_01_B	Cariel! Look out! His chains have you hooked!
VO_BOM_08_006_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterChampionFalls_04_01_C	He's got me. I'm slipping. AIEEEE!!!!
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Orc_DrekThar_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	Stormpike filth. Slay them all!
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Orc_DrekThar_InGame_BossDeath_01	NA
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Orc_DrekThar_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	Stormpike weaklings, face me -- if you dare.
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Orc_DrekThar_InGame_BossIdle_01	Your attacks are slowed by the cold, I think!
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Orc_DrekThar_InGame_BossIdle_02	You cannot defeat the Frostwolf clan!
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Orc_DrekThar_InGame_BossIdle_03	Just how long do you think you can hold that bridge?
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Orc_DrekThar_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	Spirits guide me.
VO_BOM_08_006_Male_Orc_DrekThar_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	<_Grunt_>
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_07_01	The Frostwolves retreated. Cariel had done it. But at what cost? We descended into the ravine to look for her.
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_07_02	Our search was fruitless, but then --
VO_BOM_08_003_Male_Tauren_Guff_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_07_01	Please, Rudolphus! And you too, Tavish. Help! We need your help. It's Kazakus! He's about to corrupt the naaru. Follow me. This way.
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Introduction_01_A	That's enough, Kazakus. Whatever you're brewin' ends here.
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Troll_Kazakus_InGame_Introduction_01_B	Ah, more treacherous dogs. I should have known never to trust a mercenary.
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_Turn_01_01	Help me free my friends. Then we will help you defeat Kazakus.
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Troll_Kazakus_InGame_Turn_05_01	The power of the naaru is beyond your comprehension. Perhaps you would like a demonstration!
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_09_01_A	Tauren, we were searching for our friend Cariel. She fell from the bridge in battle, and fear the worst. Have you seen her?
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_Turn_09_01_B	The brave paladin? No, but we will help you look for her! Do not give up hope, my friend.
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Troll_Kazakus_InGame_Turn_13_01	The shards have nearly turned to void. Soon you will see what I am capable of. 
VO_BOM_08_007_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_HE_Custom_IfRokaraFreed_01_A	Kept me waiting long enough.
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_HE_Custom_IfRokaraFreed_01_B	Is that a thank you? Bah! No matter. Let's get him!
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_IfBrukanFreed_01_A	Thank you, Tavish Stormpike. His magic be strong, but we can defeat Kazakus if we work together.
VO_BOM_08_007_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_HE_Custom_IfDawngraspFreed_01_A	That was a fascinating spell of binding. I still have much to learn in the way of Frost Magic. 
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Troll_Kazakus_InGame_HE_Custom_IfXyrellaPlayed_01_A	Ah, Priestess Xyrella. Onyxia was right. Leave the final shard with you, and you would deliver it to me. And here you are.
VO_BOM_08_007_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_HE_Custom_IfXyrellaPlayed_01_B	Onyxia?
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_HE_Custom_IfScabbsPlayed_01	It's over, Kazakus. Time to settle up.
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_NightElf_Kurtrus_InGame_HE_Custom_IfKurtrusPlayed_01	I fight for Cariel. You, Kazakus, shall pay for your crimes.
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Victory_PreExplosion_01_A	Surrender, Kazakus. You cannae beat all of us when we work together.
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Troll_Kazakus_InGame_Victory_PreExplosion_01_B	On the contrary, foolish mercenaries. Now you will witness the true power of Kazakusan. Ah ha HA!
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Dragon_Kazakusan_InGame_Victory_PreExplosion_01_C	That is right. Surprising absolutely no one, I AM A BLACK DRAGON!
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Troll_Kazakus_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	Your quest ends here.
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Troll_Kazakus_InGame_BossDeath_01	REUSE
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Troll_Kazakus_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	Your suffering shall be legendary. Ha, ha, ha.
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Troll_Kazakus_InGame_BossIdle_01	This naaru's power will rival the Sunwell at its peak.
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Troll_Kazakus_InGame_BossIdle_02	The phylactery is prepared.
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Troll_Kazakus_InGame_BossIdle_03	This is what I was made to do.
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Troll_Kazakus_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	Some new ingredients...
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Troll_Kazakus_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	A new recipe...
VO_BOM_08_007_Male_Troll_Kazakus_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	Watch...and cower.
VO_BOM_08_008_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_08_01_A	With a swing of his mighty tail, the black dragon Kazakusan knocked us back, freeing him to complete the assembly of the naaru.
VO_BOM_08_002_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_08_01_B	Tavish, I dropped my shard. He has all of them now. We must do something!
VO_BOM_08_008_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_08_01_C	Do something? I'm a hunter, aren't I? Let's hunt a dragon!
VO_BOM_08_008_Male_Dragon_Kazakusan_InGame_Introduction_01_A	I wield a DARK NAARU. You mortals cannot hope to defeat me. 
VO_BOM_08_008_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Introduction_01_B	This is it! Stand with me, everyone. Even you, Frostwolf.
VO_BOM_08_008_Male_Dragon_Kazakusan_InGame_Turn_03_01_A	Naaru! Destroy my enemies.
VO_BOM_08_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_Turn_03_01_B	I am Mi'da...Pure Void...I...obey.
VO_BOM_08_008_Male_Dragon_Kazakusan_InGame_Turn_07_01_A	Any last words, mortal?
VO_BOM_08_008_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_07_01_B	Aye. You messed with the wrong dwarf!
VO_BOM_08_008_Male_Dragon_Kazakusan_InGame_Turn_11_01	Even if you defeat me -- which you won't -- my sister will soon hold all of Azeroth in her claws.
VO_BOM_08_008_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_HE_Custom_IfSevenMercsInPlay_01_A	All together now. We fight as one!
VO_BOM_08_008_Male_Dragon_Kazakusan_InGame_HE_Custom_IfSevenMercsInPlay_01_B	My, my...what a motley array of fools.
VO_BOM_08_008_Male_Dragon_Kazakusan_InGame_Victory_PreExplosion_01_A	I cannot remain. I must cover my retreat. Naaru...it is time. Bathe the phylactery in your energies.
VO_BOM_08_008_Male_Dragon_Kazakusan_InGame_Victory_PreExplosion_01_B	Now, arise, Tamsin Roame, and serve Kazakusan!
VO_BOM_08_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_Victory_PreExplosion_01_C	I am reborn! The Dark Naaru has granted me eternal life!
VO_BOM_08_008_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_09_01_A	The dragon took flight with the naaru in his grip, leaving the lich behind.
VO_BOM_08_008_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_09_01_B	The Horde mercenaries didn't seem thrilled to see their old companion once more.
VO_BOM_08_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_09_01_C	Now what was it my old teacher used to say? Ah yes. Greetings...from the cold dark!

VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Elemental_Lokholar_InGame_BossIdle_03	ARE YOU FROZEN WITH FEAR?
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Elemental_Lokholar_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_B	WHO DARES SUMMON LOKHOLAR?
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Elemental_Lokholar_InGame_BossIdle_02	LET THE SNOW FALL...

VO_BOM_09_001_Male_Troll_Brukan_Emote_Picked_01	They call me Bru'kan of the Darkspear clan. And you didn't think saving the world would fall to me, now, did you?
VO_BOM_09_001_Male_Troll_Brukan_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_01_01_A	I knew this moment would come.
VO_BOM_09_001_Male_Troll_Brukan_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_01_01_B	When I first met Tamsin Roame, I sensed the darkness in her heart, but I believed she could be taught. She could fight for the glory of the Horde.
VO_BOM_09_001_Male_Troll_Brukan_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_01_01_C	But now I had to stop her before she wiped out the Horde completely.
VO_BOM_09_001_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_Introduction_01_A	It looks like the gang is all here. But no Cariel? I should have known my sister would go and get herself killed.
VO_BOM_09_001_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_Introduction_01_B	Tamsin! You will not harm another soul.
VO_BOM_09_001_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_Turn_03_01_A	At Scholomance, I was Kel'Thuzad's prize pupil. He was the first to see my potential.
VO_BOM_09_001_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_Turn_03_01_B	He taught me forbidden necromancy, even the secret to becoming a lich.
VO_BOM_09_001_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_Turn_07_01_A	I made a phylactery. If I suffered an unplanned demise, I needed only a vast source of the Light's power to restore me.
VO_BOM_09_001_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_Turn_07_01_B	The Sunwell wasn't available, but a naaru would do.
VO_BOM_09_001_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_Turn_11_01_A	My benefactor used me as a weapon, but that was a small price to pay to rid the world of my enemies.
VO_BOM_09_001_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_Turn_11_01_B	Enough! Your cruelty AND your monologuing end NOW!
VO_BOM_09_001_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_A	The naaru's power flows through me. With it, I will destroy you all!
VO_BOM_09_001_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_B	Rokara! Guff! Dawngrasp! Where are you? AHH!
VO_BOM_09_001_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	I feel so much power!

VO_BOM_09_001_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_BossIdle_02	Are you in awe?
VO_BOM_09_001_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_BossIdle_03	A pity...I would have liked to see Cariel one last time.
VO_BOM_09_001_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	Dark Naaru empower me!
VO_BOM_09_001_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	I wield the Void!
VO_BOM_09_001_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	Let chaos reign!
VO_BOM_09_002_Male_Tauren_Guff_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_02_01_A	Look! He is waking up. Bru'kan, are you all right?
VO_BOM_09_002_Male_Troll_Brukan_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_02_01_B	Unh...I may be a fossil but I am not extinct yet. What happened?
VO_BOM_09_002_Female_Orc_Rokara_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_02_01_C	Tamsin created a shockwave that knocked us all back. The shadows were so dark I couldn't see where the Alliance went.
VO_BOM_09_002_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_02_01_D	Come, Bru'kan. Sit by the fire and regain your strength.
VO_BOM_09_002_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_Introduction_01_A	We should eat something to regain our strength.
VO_BOM_09_002_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_Introduction_01_B	Woohoo! I love snacks.
VO_BOM_09_002_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_Turn_03_01_A	Looks like some kindling elementals are creeping out of the fire.
VO_BOM_09_002_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_Turn_03_01_B	Bru'kan, keep them at bay while I whip us up some grub.
VO_BOM_09_002_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterFirstWaveCleared_01_A	Guff, my friend, what troubles you?
VO_BOM_09_002_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterFirstWaveCleared_01_B	I am a long way from Mulgore, Master Bru'kan. Sometimes I think back on our journey and wonder...will my people ever be proud of me?
VO_BOM_09_002_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterFirstWaveCleared_01_C	They already are.
VO_BOM_09_002_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterSecondWaveCleared_01_A	It's all starting to make sense. Lady Prestor insinuated herself into the Alliance, and Kazakus did the same thing with the Horde.
VO_BOM_09_002_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterSecondWaveCleared_01_B	They fooled everyone into gathering the shards of naaru for them.
VO_BOM_09_002_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterSecondWaveCleared_01_C	Rest your brilliant mind, Dawngrasp. I knew this moment would come. They will not succeed. We will save the naaru.
VO_BOM_09_002_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterThirdWaveCleared_01_A	I'm glad you're okay, Bru'kan. I thought I'd lost you. I don't know what we would have done.
VO_BOM_09_002_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterThirdWaveCleared_01_B	No setback ever truly be the end, no matter how great. You will learn. Never stop trying.
VO_BOM_09_002_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterThirdWaveCleared_01_C	Besides, I have the Far Sight! I have seen it all -- there be nothing to worry about.
VO_BOM_09_002_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterFourthWaveCleared_01_A	Food's ready! I grilled up some Savory Deviate Delight.
VO_BOM_09_002_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterFourthWaveCleared_01_B	I would eat that with caution, Rokara. The last time I tasted one, I could not stop talking like a pirate!
VO_BOM_09_002_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_HE_Custom_AfterFourthWaveCleared_01_C	And moreover, have you been carrying that deviate fish around since the Wailing Caverns?
VO_BOM_09_002_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_A	When I peer into the flames, I see the path forward. There be great elemental energies in this valley.
VO_BOM_09_002_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_B	I will tap into these energies and summon an elemental strong enough to battle a lich. Will you help me, friends?
VO_BOM_09_002_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_C	Of course. We will fight by your side until the very end.
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Troll_Brukan_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_03_01_A	At first light, we set out through the forest in search of the elemental energies. With that power, the lives of everyone in Alterac Valley could be saved.
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Troll_Brukan_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_03_01_B	Unfortunately, the Stormpikes had not received the message.
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Human_Ichman_InGame_Introduction_01_A	Enemy spotted. I'm starting my attack run.
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_Introduction_01_B	Gryphon riders! Watch out!
VO_BOM_09_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_Turn_01_01_A	Get down here and fight fair, human!
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_Turn_01_01_A	Ooh, pretty birds!
VO_BOM_09_003_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Turn_01_01_A	My magic will ruffle their feathers.
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Human_Ichman_InGame_Turn_05_01_A	Turn and burn!
VO_BOM_09_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_Turn_05_01_A	Gah! His talons are sharp.
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_Turn_05_01_A	Careful! If you fly low you might hit something.
VO_BOM_09_003_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Turn_05_01_A	Burn? A good Pyroblast could arrange that.
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Human_Ichman_InGame_Turn_09_01_A	I don't like you cuz you guys are dangerous!
VO_BOM_09_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_Turn_09_01_A	Dangerous? You better believe it.
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_Turn_09_01_A	Meeeee?
VO_BOM_09_003_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Turn_09_01_A	Me, dangerous? I'd rather be studying in a library!
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Human_Ichman_InGame_Turn_13_01_A	We're experiencing some turbulance.
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_Turn_13_01_B	Just wait until I strike you with lightning!
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_A	More Stormpikes will be on their way. We can take shelter in that mine. Follow me.
VO_BOM_09_003_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_B	You want to retreat? Now is the time to fight!
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_C	No, Rokara! Please, listen to me. Trust me.
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Human_Ichman_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	Maintain radio silence.
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Human_Ichman_InGame_BossDeath_01	I'm hit!
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Human_Ichman_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	Enemy down. Returning to base.
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Human_Ichman_InGame_BossIdle_01	You are now free to move about the combat zone.
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Human_Ichman_InGame_BossIdle_02	Clear skies.
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Human_Ichman_InGame_BossIdle_03	Bogeys in sight.
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Human_Ichman_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	Fox two.
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Human_Ichman_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	Attach claw!
VO_BOM_09_003_Male_Human_Ichman_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	Let 'er rip!
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Troll_Brukan_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_04_01_A	The mine was cold and dark and -- alas -- occupied.
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Troll_Brukan_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_04_01_B	Out of the darkness we saw glowing red eyes...and flickering candles.
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_Introduction_01_A	We mean you no harm. Please help us.
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Snivvle_InGame_Introduction_01_B	Bah! Snivvle be smelling mercenaries. Go away! Snivvle be the king of the mine.
VO_BOM_09_004_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_Turn_03_01_A	Ugh, kobolds. I hate these things.
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Snivvle_InGame_Turn_03_01_B	We be hating you too, green mus-ca-ly giant!
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Snivvle_InGame_Turn_05_01_A	These stinky trespassers be strong! Send our least valuable kobolds in first! Togwaggle! Go get 'em.
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Togwaggle_InGame_Turn_05_01_B	Y-yes, Your Candle-iness. Perhaps this one be getting treasure as a reward?
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Snivvle_InGame_Turn_05_01_C	Quiet! Or I be taking your candle.
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Snivvle_InGame_Turn_09_01_A	Loose the big beasts from deeeep down in the mine.
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_Turn_09_01_B	Big beasts? Maybe they will be friendly.
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_Turn_09_01_C	You know, I have started to predict disappointment.
VO_BOM_09_004_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_Turn_11_01_A	Stand behind me. My shield will protect you.
VO_BOM_09_004_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Turn_11_01_B	Cariel Roame? You're alive!
VO_BOM_09_004_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_Turn_11_01_C	Paladins are taught to heal quite early in their training, you know.
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Snivvle_InGame_HE_Custom_IfFirstCrateBroken_01_A	Those be Snivvle's treasures. Do not break the crates!
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Togwaggle_InGame_HE_Custom_IfSecondCrateBroken_01_A	Ooooooooooooh. Lantern Crown be greatest candle of all.
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_A	That be the last of them. Cariel, we are on an urgent mission to stop Tamsin. Will you help us?
VO_BOM_09_004_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_B	My sister's alive? Again!
VO_BOM_09_004_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_C	Uh, I mean, yes. I am with you. Lead on.
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Togwaggle_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_D	Ah, Snivvle be snuffed. Togwaggle be king now, get all the treasures. Yah ha ha!
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Snivvle_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	You stay out of Coldtooth Mine!
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Snivvle_InGame_BossDeath_01	<_Death_>
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Snivvle_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	Mercenaries. Bah! What take them so long to show up?
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Snivvle_InGame_BossIdle_01	Whitewhiskers, pierce them with small instruments!
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Snivvle_InGame_BossIdle_02	Keep back the Darkness. And also thieves!
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Snivvle_InGame_BossIdle_03	What is all the fighting outside? Do the green and bearded ones still swing sharp things wildly?
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Snivvle_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	Ah ha ha!
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Snivvle_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	What is this?
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Snivvle_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	You no take candle!
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Troll_Brukan_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_05_01_A	With Cariel beside us, we were five once again. I led my youthful companions far across the valley, until we came upon a hermit. A primalist.
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Troll_Brukan_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_05_01_B	I knew this moment would come. This being was deeply in tune with the elements. With his help, the power I needed to stop Tamsin would be mine.
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_Introduction_01_A	Hermit...I have come for Lokholar.
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Tauren_Primalist_InGame_Introduction_01_B	You seek power...but does the power seek you?
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Tauren_Primalist_InGame_Turn_03_01_A	Breathe slowly, Bru'kan. Close your eyes...and look! What do you see?
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Orc_DrekThar_InGame_Turn_03_01_B	You do not wish to fight our fight. Why have you always run away?
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Tauren_Primalist_InGame_Turn_05_01_A	Clear the vision from your mind.
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Tauren_Primalist_InGame_HE_Custom_IfDrektharVisionDestroyed_01_A	Good. Now look deeper.
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Orc_Thrall_InGame_HE_Custom_IfDrektharVisionDestroyed_01_B	Bru'kan, my old friend. Where is your family? Are they safe?
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_IfDrektharVisionDestroyed_01_C	No! No! This is too much!
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Tauren_Primalist_InGame_HE_Custom_IfThrallVisionDestroyed_01_A	The power is close. Can you feel it?
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Human_DaelinProudmoore_InGame_HE_Custom_IfThrallVisionDestroyed_01_B	Come, savages, atone for what you did in Stormwind. In Lordaeron.
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_OneTurnAfterDaelinPlayed_01_A	Please, I left them. I was afraid.
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Tauren_Primalist_InGame_HE_Custom_OneTurnAfterDaelinPlayed_01_B	Then you are truly unworthy.
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_TwoTurnsAfterDaelinPlayed_01_A	I have learned. I will fight!
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Tauren_Primalist_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_A	You are worthy. The Ice Lord awakens!
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Elemental_Lokholar_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_B	WHO DARES SUMMON LOKHOLAR?
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Tauren_Primalist_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	Lokholar whispers to me.
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Tauren_Primalist_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	You are unworthy.
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Tauren_Primalist_InGame_BossIdle_01	You hear his whispers on the wind.
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Tauren_Primalist_InGame_BossIdle_02	You feel his breath on frigid nights.
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Tauren_Primalist_InGame_BossIdle_03	What have you seen with your mind's eye?
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Tauren_Primalist_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	Primal power!
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Tauren_Primalist_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	From the heart of the valley.
VO_BOM_09_005_Male_Tauren_Primalist_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	I trust in the elements.
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Troll_Brukan_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_06_01_A	Lokholar the Ice Lord towered over the treetops. Shards of ice rained from his massive body. I knew this moment would come. I had to bend the Ice Lord to my will.
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Elemental_Lokholar_InGame_Introduction_01_A	WHO DARES TO SUMMON ME?
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_Introduction_01_B	Lokholar, you will obey me. I am Bru'kan of the Darkspear!
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Elemental_Lokholar_InGame_Turn_03_01_A	I HUNGER FOR A BATTLEFIELD.
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_Turn_03_01_B	Stand with me, everyone! This will not be easy.
VO_BOM_09_006_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_Turn_07_01_A	You all fight well together.
VO_BOM_09_006_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_Turn_07_01_B	We're a team, and you're not so bad yourself.
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_Turn_11_01_A	Dawngrasp, what is the matter?
VO_BOM_09_006_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Turn_11_01_B	Nothing...this giant elemental is giving me ideas. Freezy frosty ideas!
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_IfGuffDealtLethal_01_A	Guff, where are you going?
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_HE_Custom_IfGuffDealtLethal_01_B	Do not worry. I have an idea. I will return soon! Toodles!
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_IfGuffDealtLethal_01_C	Sigh...that tauren...
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Elemental_Lokholar_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_A	YOU...ARE...WORTHY...
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_B	Then come with me, Lokholar. We have a war to finish.
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Elemental_Lokholar_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	NONE SHALL STAND AGAINST THE MIGHT OF THE ICE LORD!
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Elemental_Lokholar_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	YOU ARE NOT WORTHY. I RETURN TO MY SLUMBER.
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Elemental_Lokholar_InGame_BossIdle_01	MY CHILL IS FOREVER.
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Elemental_Lokholar_InGame_BossIdle_02	LET THE SNOW FALL...
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Elemental_Lokholar_InGame_BossIdle_03	ARE YOU FROZEN WITH FEAR?
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Elemental_Lokholar_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	FREEZE!
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Elemental_Lokholar_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	RAIN AND SLEET.
VO_BOM_09_006_Male_Elemental_Lokholar_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	ICE RISES.
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Troll_Brukan_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_07_01_A	Lokholar scooped us up in his icy grip. He carried us through the valley to the Field of Strife, where the Stormpikes had pushed back Drek'Thar's warriors. 
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Troll_Brukan_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_07_01_B	We crashed between the combatants with the force of a blizzard. This fighting had to stop.
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_Introduction_01_A	The Stormpikes will not cower at the sight of a snowball! Fight!
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_Introduction_01_B	This battle ends now! The fate of Azeroth depends on us!
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_Turn_03_01_A	I will lock you in prisons of ice if I must. The lich must be stopped.
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_Turn_03_01_B	The naaru must be saved!
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_Turn_17_01_B	Guff! Yes! Look what you have done.
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_HE_Custom_IfVanndarAtTenHealth_01_A	Tavish, you lazy, stinking wendigo. Fight them!
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_HE_Custom_IfVanndarAtTenHealth_01_B	I'm afraid not, cousin. I think you're on the wrong side.
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_A	Stop! Stop! Stop! Stand down, Stormpikes. And you too, Frostwolves. Just what do you want, shaman?
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_B	The lich Tamsin Roame must be stopped. I will lead a small force to eliminate her.
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_C	The rest of you must flee the valley. There is no telling what Tamsin is capable of, and the naaru must be saved.
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	I'm not afraid of you or your giant snowman.
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	The great Ice Lord is defeated. Now onwards to the Frostwolf base!
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_BossIdle_01	Do not lose courage, friends.
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_BossIdle_02	When I'm through, you'll be the Puddle Lord.
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_BossIdle_03	All I wanted was to do some archaeology.
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	To arms!
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	Battle stations!
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Dwarf_Vanndar_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	Rise up!
VO_BOM_09_007_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_Turn_17_01_A	Yoohoo! I'm back. And I brought a friend!
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_08_01_A	Back so soon? Are you trying to fail? Don't you know how overpowered warlocks are?
VO_BOM_09_008_Male_Troll_Brukan_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_08_01_B	You have more lives than a cat, Tamsin Roame, but this will be your last. Now you face Bru'kan! ATTACK!
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_Introduction_01_A	You are but a nuisance. I will destroy you, and then all the naaru's power will be mine.
VO_BOM_09_008_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_Introduction_01_B	No! I knew this moment would come. I will fight you. I will stop you!
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_HE_Custom_IfCarielPlayed_01_A	Why, Care, it seems reports of your demise were unfortunately exaggerated.
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_HE_Custom_IfCarielPlayed_01_B	I love you, Tamsin. But I won't forgive you. And I will defeat you.
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_HE_Custom_IfCarielPlayed_01_C	Blah blah blah.
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_HE_Custom_IfXyrellaPlayed_01_A	Xyrella! Pity. I liked your old look.
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_HE_Custom_IfXyrellaPlayed_01_B	I know the shadow and the light. You cannot stop me.
VO_BOM_09_008_Male_NightElf_Kurtrus_InGame_HE_Custom_IfKurtrusPlayed_01_A	Warlock, your reckoning has come.
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_HE_Custom_IfKurtrusPlayed_01_B	You want some demons, Ashfallen? Here! Have them all!
VO_BOM_09_008_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_IfRokaraPlayed_01_A	You have grown strong, Rokara.
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_HE_Custom_IfRokaraPlayed_01_B	Strong enough to carry your backpack, right?
VO_BOM_09_008_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_IfRokaraPlayed_01_C	Strong enough to carry the Horde.
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_HE_Custom_IfIvusDestroyed_01	So long, Forest Lord.
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_HE_Custom_IfLokholarDestroyed_01	Bye, bye, Ice Lord.
VO_BOM_09_008_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTamsinHalfHealth_01_A	She be getting stronger! All of you, run! Go find the naaru. Stop the dragons.
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTamsinHalfHealth_01_B	Bru'kan!
VO_BOM_09_008_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTamsinHalfHealth_01_C	Go!!!
VO_BOM_09_008_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTamsinHalfHealthPlusOne_01_A	Why do you linger, paladin?
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTamsinHalfHealthPlusOne_01_B	She is my responsibility. Please, let me finish this fight with you.
VO_BOM_09_008_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTamsinHalfHealthPlusOne_01_C	So you know what I intend to do.
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTamsinTenHealth_01_A	What is that look in your eyes, old troll? You think you can fight me -- and live?
VO_BOM_09_008_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTamsinTenHealth_01_B	I knew this moment would come. I am not afraid.
VO_BOM_09_008_Male_Troll_Brukan_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTamsinTenHealth_01_C	RAAAAAH!!!!!
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01	Ah! Bru'kan! Tamsin? They're gone...
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	Be honest. I make this look good.
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	I've been saying it all along. I'm the greatest that has ever been.
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_BossIdle_01	Where's Guff? I miss my little funnel cake.
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_BossIdle_02	No matter how strong you get, I will always be stronger.
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_BossIdle_03	I am inevitable!
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	I am invincible!
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	You cannot defeat me!
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Undead_LichTamsin_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	Cower at my name.
VO_BOM_09_004_Female_Human_Cariel_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_09_01_A	When the blinding light faded, and the dust cleared, the old shaman and my sister were no more.
VO_BOM_09_004_Female_Human_Cariel_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_09_01_B	I grieved this troll, this brave old soul who put an end to that which I could not. He saved my life and countless others.
VO_BOM_09_004_Female_Human_Cariel_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_09_01_C	The task fell to me to let the others know what had transpired on that battlefield. But the next task, our final task, would be shared by all of us. We had to raid the dragons.
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_Turn_15_01_A	Thank you for this information, Scabbs. But what are we supposed to do with it?
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTurnStartsWithXyrellaAndGuffInPlay_01_A	The Light flows through you, Guff. I feel it.
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_A	Onyxia is slain! Please, we must hurry to my Runi.
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_Turn_03_01_A	Abomination! How is this possible?
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_B	The Exodar is just ahead. Come with me the rest of the way, Dawngrasp.
VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_C	You have been a true friend to see this through to the end.
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Togwaggle_Emote_Play_01	Togwaggle be small and naive kobold.

VO_Mida_Female_Naaru_LETL_Intro_01	I am Mi'da...Pure Void...I...destroy.
VO_Mida_Female_Naaru_LETL_Idle_01	It is impossible. I am unwhole. I wither.
VO_Mida_Female_Naaru_LETL_Idle_02	Matters of the naaru are beyond your comprehension.
VO_Mida_Female_Naaru_LETL_Idle_03	I share your memories.
VO_Mida_Female_Naaru_LETL_Ability_01	I will give you my light if I can.

VO_Onyxia_Female_Dragon_Fluff_01	Don't take it personally. We all got what we wanted.
VO_Onyxia_Female_Dragon_Fluff_02	Common sellswords and nothing more! 
VO_Onyxia_Female_Dragon_Fluff_03	You are nothing without me.
VO_Onyxia_Female_Dragon_Fluff_04	It seems you'll need another lesson, mortals!
VO_Onyxia_Female_Dragon_Fluff_05	I don't need a reason to set your world on fire. But you just gave me one.
VO_Onyxia_Female_Dragon_Fluff_06	How easy it was to manipulate you. All it took was a little gold and a promise of glory.
VO_Onyxia_Female_Dragon_PhaseTransition_01	Let's see if you can keep up.
VO_Onyxia_Female_Dragon_PhaseTransition_02	Still here? Then let's make it more interesting.

#BOM 10 Dawngrasp
VO_BOM_10_001_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_Emote_Picked_01	Varden Dawngrasp -- aspiring Magister and accidental dragon hunter. There's only one battle left. I really hope I don't mess this up!
VO_BOM_10_001_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_01_01_A	Bru'kan was like a father to all of us. When he sent us away I felt my chest tighten. Somewhere, deep down, I knew I'd never see him again.
VO_BOM_10_001_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_01_01_B	For a long time, Horde and Alliance stood there, as silent as the icy pines. Then, through the snow, a lone figure approached. Cariel Roame.
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Human_Cariel_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_01_01_C	I'm sorry...Bru'kan didn't make it. But Tamsin is gone. It's over. Let us pay tribute to our fallen companion...and plan our next move.
VO_BOM_10_001_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Introduction_01_A	Does anyone want to say a few words?
VO_BOM_10_001_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_Introduction_01_B	This is YOUR fault, Cariel. How could you let this happen?
VO_BOM_10_001_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Turn_01_01	That is not exactly what I meant.
VO_BOM_10_001_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_Turn_03_01_A	He fought with honor. He saved me.
VO_BOM_10_001_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_Turn_03_01_B	You should have saved him! 
VO_BOM_10_001_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Turn_03_01_C	Rokara, enough. It's time to say goodbye.
VO_BOM_10_001_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_Turn_05_01_A	I will go first. Umm...Bru'kan was my hero. He believed in me when no one else did.
VO_BOM_10_001_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_Turn_05_01_B	Like that time I tried to free the Darkmoon Rabbit and keep it as a pet. Bru'kan was the first to forgive me.
VO_BOM_10_001_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_Turn_07_01	He saved us all. I won't forget that. We didn't see eye to eye on much, but...thank you. All of you.
VO_BOM_10_001_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_Turn_09_01_A	Bru'kan taught me what it means to be Horde. He built me into the warrior I am. Thank you, Master Bru'kan.
VO_BOM_10_001_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Turn_09_01_B	He taught me that all are welcome in the Horde. I never thought the blood elves would have a home.
VO_BOM_10_001_Male_NightElf_Kurtrus_InGame_Turn_11_01_A	Cariel, are you all right?
VO_BOM_10_001_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_Turn_11_01_B	I'm fine. Tamsin is finally gone. It's over.
VO_BOM_10_001_Male_NightElf_Kurtrus_InGame_Turn_11_01_C	Not yet. The naaru must be saved, and the dragons must face our vengeance.
VO_BOM_10_001_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_Turn_11_01_D	Justice.
VO_BOM_10_001_Male_NightElf_Kurtrus_InGame_Turn_11_01_E	R-right. Justice.
VO_BOM_10_001_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_Turn_13_01_A	Enough. No more salt on our faces. Kazakus is to blame for all this. How do we stop him?
VO_BOM_10_001_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_Turn_13_01_B	All the ingredients have finally come together. It all makes sense!
VO_BOM_10_001_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_Turn_01_C	Onyxia fooled the Alliance. Kazakusan fooled the Horde. They're both dragons in disguise.
VO_BOM_10_001_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_Turn_15_01_A	Thank you for this information, Scabbs. But what are we supposed to do with it?
VO_BOM_10_001_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_Turn_15_01_B	Lady Prestor fled Stormwind as soon as the shards left the Deadmines. No one knows where she is.
VO_BOM_10_001_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Turn_15_01_C	There is something you all should know. Something I have not told any of you before.
VO_BOM_10_001_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Turn_17_01_A	After the Night of Falling Stars, Kazakus came to Silvermoon, my home.
VO_BOM_10_001_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Turn_17_01_B	He wanted the blood elves to help him gather the shards of naaru in Kalimdor. Much like what Onyxia did in Stormwind.
VO_BOM_10_001_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Turn_17_01_C	Suspicious, I followed him. That is why I was in the Barrens. There I learned he sought the shards for evil ends.
VO_BOM_10_001_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_A	The leaders of my city spoke with Kazakus often.
VO_BOM_10_001_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_B	I will return to Silvermoon and consult with them. Perhaps they will know where the dragons are hiding.
VO_BOM_10_001_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_C	The rest of you must go to your people -- raise an army! We'll need it if we hope to stand a chance against these dragons.
VO_BOM_10_001_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	I need more time. I'm not ready to say goodbye.
VO_BOM_10_001_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_BossIdle_01	I'll never see him again.
VO_BOM_10_001_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_BossIdle_02	It is so strange to see your faces. I wonder if my face looks like that.
VO_BOM_10_001_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_BossIdle_03	I know I can get through this. My strength is close to my heart.
VO_BOM_10_002_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_02_01_A	I stepped through a portal of my own making, and in an instant, I was home, in Silvermoon.
VO_BOM_10_002_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_02_01_B	When I arrived, Lor'themar Theron was waiting for me. He was the Regent Lord of Quel'Thalas, ruler of the Blood Elves in my prince's absence.
VO_BOM_10_002_Male_BloodElf_Lorthemar_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_02_01_C	The facts of your campaign have reached our ears, Varden Dawngrasp. Sentinels -- arrest them.
VO_BOM_10_002_Male_BloodElf_Lorthemar_InGame_Introduction_01_A	I did my best to defend you when Kael'thas departed, but now I hear you conspire with the enemy.
VO_BOM_10_002_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Introduction_01_B	The Alliance is not our enemy -- Kazakus is. 
VO_BOM_10_002_Male_BloodElf_Lorthemar_InGame_Turn_01_01	Come along quietly, Dawngrasp.
VO_BOM_10_002_Male_BloodElf_Lorthemar_InGame_Turn_05_01_A	You have grown quite strong. Grand Magister Rommath would be impressed.
VO_BOM_10_002_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Turn_07_01_A	What were the Horde's dealings with Kazakus? I want answers.
VO_BOM_10_002_Male_BloodElf_Lorthemar_InGame_Turn_07_01_B	We knew the shards were pieces of a fractured naaru. Kazakus offered to help us attain them. We wanted that power.
VO_BOM_10_002_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Turn_11_01_A	Something felt off about Kazakus, but I never would have guessed he was a dragon.
VO_BOM_10_002_Male_BloodElf_Lorthemar_InGame_Turn_11_01_B	He played us all for fools. But he let one thing slip -- a name -- that might be the key to everything.
VO_BOM_10_002_Male_BloodElf_Lorthemar_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_A	When Kazakus explained his plan to gather the shards, he said he had a refuge in Dustwallow Marsh, close to the Barrens. 
VO_BOM_10_002_Male_BloodElf_Lorthemar_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_B	I will lead a force of our finest champions there, and you will be by my side.
VO_BOM_10_002_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_C	Me, sir? But I thought -- ...
VO_BOM_10_002_Male_BloodElf_Lorthemar_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_D	Presumably you think this better than being locked up again? If you are right, and the Alliance can be trusted, all will be forgiven.
VO_BOM_10_002_Male_BloodElf_Lorthemar_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	Bal'a dash, malanore.
VO_BOM_10_002_Male_BloodElf_Lorthemar_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	You have come a long way, only to fail.
VO_BOM_10_002_Male_BloodElf_Lorthemar_InGame_BossIdle_01	What I do, I do for Quel'Thalas.
VO_BOM_10_002_Male_BloodElf_Lorthemar_InGame_BossIdle_02	My great fear is that the Lich King will return to Silvermoon to finish the job.
VO_BOM_10_002_Male_BloodElf_Lorthemar_InGame_BossIdle_03	I am no king, but you will obey.
VO_BOM_10_002_Male_BloodElf_Lorthemar_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	I spy...
VO_BOM_10_002_Male_BloodElf_Lorthemar_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	By my little eye...
VO_BOM_10_002_Male_BloodElf_Lorthemar_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	Keen sight!
VO_BOM_10_003_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_03_01_A	When our contingent arrived in Kalimdor, I could not believe my eyes. My companions had journeyed across the world and brought fighters from every corner of Azeroth.
VO_BOM_10_003_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_03_01_B	Rokara led grunts from Orgrimmar, and Guff druids from Thunder Bluff. Scabbs brought SI:7, and Tavish recruited Ironforge riflemen. As we made a staging area in Theramore, Cariel approached.
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Human_Cariel_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_03_01_C	Dawngrasp, the representatives from Stormwind have arrived. There's, ah…someone I'd like you to meet.
VO_BOM_10_003_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Introduction_01_A	King Varian! It is an honor.
VO_BOM_10_003_Male_Human_Varian_InGame_Introduction_01_B	Onyxia and Kazakus hold my son hostage. My allies and I intend to lead the attack. Will you join us?
VO_BOM_10_003_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Turn_01_01_A	It would be an honor.
VO_BOM_10_003_Male_Human_Varian_InGame_Turn_01_01_B	Then allow me to introduce Valeera Sanguinar. She has saved my life more than once.
VO_BOM_10_003_Female_BloodElf_Valeera_InGame_Turn_03_01_A	I like you, but you have to keep your spells flying fast in the heat of battle.
VO_BOM_10_003_Female_BloodElf_Valeera_InGame_HE_Custom_IfValeeraDestroyed_01_A	You're pretty good. Now where's that gnome? I am starving.
VO_BOM_10_003_Male_Human_Varian_InGame_HE_Custom_IfValeeraDestroyed_01_B	This is Broll. He has carried me through many battles. Literally. Uhh. On his back.
VO_BOM_10_003_Male_NightElf_Broll_InGame_HE_Custom_IfValeeraDestroyedPlus1_01_A	I will try to draw the dragon's attention. You must summon every speck of magic you possess.
VO_BOM_10_003_Male_NightElf_Broll_InGame_HE_Custom_IfBrollDestroyed_01_A	You are ready. Now where is Guff Runetotem? I want to meet the tauren who defeated the Stormwind army over a family of squirrels.
VO_BOM_10_003_Male_Human_Varian_InGame_HE_Custom_IfBrollDestroyed_01_B	Ignore him, and prepare for your next test -- Jaina Proudmoore.
VO_BOM_10_003_Female_Human_Jaina_InGame_HE_Custom_IfBrollDestroyedPlus1_01_A	Prince Kael'thas spoke highly of you, Varden Dawngrasp. I am glad to finally meet.
VO_BOM_10_003_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_HE_Custom_IfBrollDestroyedPlus1_01_B	The pleasure is mine, Lady Jaina. Kind of fanning out, honestly.
VO_BOM_10_003_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_HE_Custom_IfBrollDestroyedPlus2_01_B	Maybe when this is over we could train together! Or study, perhaps?
VO_BOM_10_003_Female_Human_Jaina_InGame_HE_Custom_IfBrollDestroyedPlus2_01_C	If there is not some other world-threatening catastrophe that demands our attention, that would be…nice.
VO_BOM_10_003_Female_Human_Jaina_InGame_HE_Custom_IfJainaDestroyed_01_A	I am satisfied. Kael did not exaggerate your talents.
VO_BOM_10_003_Male_Human_Varian_InGame_HE_Custom_IfJainaDestroyed_01_B	Now, your final test. Let's see how you handle me.
VO_BOM_10_003_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_HE_Custom_IfJainaDestroyed_01_C	Wait, TWO King Varians?
VO_BOM_10_003_Male_Human_Varian_InGame_HE_Custom_IfJainaDestroyed_01_D	Yes, it's... uh... complicated.
VO_BOM_10_003_Male_Human_Varian_InGame_Victory_PreExplosion_01_A	That will do. We ride at once to Dustwallow Marsh. Let not your courage fail, brave souls.
VO_BOM_10_003_Male_Human_Varian_InGame_Victory_PreExplosion_01_B	This will be your greatest battle yet, but we fight for survival. For Azeroth!
VO_BOM_10_003_Male_Human_Varian_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	Though I am king, you may always speak to me.
VO_BOM_10_003_Male_Human_Varian_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	Perhaps it would be better if Jaina led our mages in the coming fight.
VO_BOM_10_003_Male_Human_Varian_InGame_BossIdle_01	The bards will sing of our coming victory.
VO_BOM_10_003_Male_Human_Varian_InGame_BossIdle_02	Onyxia and her brood won't stand a chance against us.
VO_BOM_10_003_Male_Human_Varian_InGame_BossIdle_03	I was a gladiator, you know. I won't hestiate to fight!
VO_BOM_10_003_Male_Human_Varian_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	For Stormwind!
VO_BOM_10_003_Male_Human_Varian_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	To arms!
VO_BOM_10_003_Male_Human_Varian_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	Prepare to attack!
VO_BOM_10_004_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_04_01_A	Into the noxious marsh we rode, and then, out of the gloom, rose the skull-shaped entrance of a dark cavern.
VO_BOM_10_004_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_04_01_B	As our raiding party descended, the heat was intense; the air reeked of sulphur and reptilian breath. Suddenly, a voice came from below.
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_04_01_C	How fortuitous. Usually, I must leave my lair in order to feed.
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_Introduction_01_A	You dare challenge the daughter of Deathwing!?
VO_BOM_10_004_Male_Gnome_GuildLeader_InGame_Turn_01_01_A	H'okay, everybody listen up! Odd groups left! Even groups right!
VO_BOM_10_004_Male_Gnome_GuildLeader_InGame_Turn_01_01_B	Last two groups are WHELP GROUPS.
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_Turn_01_01_C	Silence, mortal.
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_Turn_05_01_A	With the power of the DARK NAARU, your fates are sealed.
VO_BOM_10_004_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Turn_05_01_B	Rokara! Cariel! To the front! Pull her attention away from us.
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_Turn_07_01_A	I have allies of my own. Kazakusan! Come, brother.
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_HE_Custom_IfCarielDestroysMinion_01_A	Whoa! You flattened that one.
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_HE_Custom_IfCarielDestroysMinion_01_B	Come, we fight side by side.
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTurnStartsWithCarielAndKurtrusInPlay_01_A	Kurtrus...I need to tell you something. When I close my eyes I see her face.
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Human_Cariel_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTurnStartsWithCarielAndKurtrusInPlay_01_B	Tamsin haunts me. I...don't know what to do.
VO_BOM_10_004_Male_NightElf_Kurtrus_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTurnStartsWithCarielAndKurtrusInPlay_01_B	I dedicated my life to vanquishing demons, but I never thought to face the demons in me.
VO_BOM_10_004_Male_NightElf_Kurtrus_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTurnStartsWithCarielAndKurtrusInPlay_01_C	Maybe, in time, I can help quell the demons in you.
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTavishDestroysMinion_01_A	Nice shot, Stormpike.
VO_BOM_10_004_Male_Dwarf_Tavish_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTavishDestroysMinion_01_B	Ach, thank ya. But that doesn't mean we're friends, Frostwolf!
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Orc_Rokara_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTavishDestroysMinion_01_C	All right, don't get your beard in a twist.
VO_BOM_08_004_Male_Dragon_Kazakusan_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_A	Onyxia, I am not a pawn to be sacrificed. I must escape. I must fly!
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_B	I need him not. Come my brood. Fly to my defense! Your mother needs you!
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	Learn your place, mortal!
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	Now my brood shall feed!
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_BossIdle_01	The naaru will deliver Azeroth to me!
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_BossIdle_02	You have all been pieces in my game.
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_BossIdle_03	Your actions are not your own. You are puppets, and I hold the strings!
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	Burn!
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	I am the broodmother!
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	My children will feed on this land!
VO_BOM_10_005_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_05_01_A	Thousands of leathery eggshells split open at once, and veritable clouds of flapping, snapping dragon whelps overtook our forces. Onyxia loomed above us all, a HIVE sending forth her swarm.
VO_BOM_10_005_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_Introduction_01_A	Feast, my children, on these mortals, and grow strong! Feel the naaru's power imbue you!
VO_BOM_10_005_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Introduction_01_B	Healers, defend us! Everyone, brace yourselves!
VO_BOM_10_005_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_HE_Custom_IfGuffDestroysWhelp_01	Look, a new friend!
VO_BOM_10_005_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_HE_Custom_IfGuffDestroysWhelp_02	Come join our side.
VO_BOM_10_005_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_HE_Custom_IfGuffDestroysWhelp_03	Well aren't you a little cutie patootie?
VO_BOM_10_005_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_HE_Custom_IfGuffDestroysWhelp_04	Hello! I am Guff.
VO_BOM_09_005_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTurnStartsWithXyrellaAndGuffInPlay_01_A	The Light flows through you, Guff. I feel it.
VO_BOM_10_005_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTurnStartsWithXyrellaAndGuffInPlay_01_B	I fight for this land. For the Earth Mother. For your daughter, too.
VO_BOM_10_005_Male_Tauren_Guff_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTurnStartsWithXyrellaAndGuffInPlay_01_C	I do not wish to fight, but we all have something worth fighting for.
VO_BOM_10_005_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTurnStartsWithScabbsInPlay_01_A	Scabbs! Be careful!
VO_BOM_10_005_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_InGame_HE_Custom_IfTurnStartsWithScabbsInPlay_01_B	Don't worry about me. I've dealt with rats in the kitchen bigger than these whelps!
VO_BOM_10_005_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_A	This meaningless exertion bores me. I'll incinerate you from above!
VO_BOM_10_005_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_B	She's taking off. Clear the center, everyone. Look out!
VO_BOM_10_005_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	You will find I am not easily threatened.
VO_BOM_10_005_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	I will wipe you all out. Again and again.
VO_BOM_10_005_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_BossIdle_01	Do you feel the heat?
VO_BOM_10_005_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_BossIdle_02	You will be a tasty morsel.
VO_BOM_10_005_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_BossIdle_03	I will wear the naaru as a crown!
VO_BOM_10_005_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	Fly, my beauties!
VO_BOM_10_005_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	The plot is hatched!
VO_BOM_10_005_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	Target the spellcasters!
VO_BOM_10_006_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_06_01_A	Onyxia rained fire down on us. The floor of her lair began to break apart. Soldiers plummeted into a sea of roiling magma below.
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_06_01_B	The naaru is mine. I will not fail! Now you will meet your end!
VO_BOM_10_006_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Introduction_01_A	Stay strong, everyone! Don't give up!
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_Introduction_01_B	I have tried to teach you, and still you persist. Well...this is your final lesson!
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfDawngraspTargetsOnyxia_01	Ah...the young elf mage. So valiant. So vulnerable.
VO_BOM_10_006_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_HE_Custom_IfNaaruDestroyed_01	The naaru has shattered. Now is our chance!
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfOnyxiaPlaysTailSweep_01	I'll sweep out the trash!
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfOnyxiaPlaysWingBuffet_01	My wings make storms!
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfOnyxiaPlaysBreathOfFire_1_01	Hot under the collar?
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfOnyxiaPlaysBreathOfFire_2_01	Bathe in fire!
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfOnyxiaPlaysBreathOfFire_3_01	You will BURN!
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfOnyxiaPlaysBellowingRoar_01	<ROAR>
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfOnyxiaPlaysDeepBreath_01	Ready my flames!
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfOnyxiaPlaysUltimateImpfestation_01	Tamsin Roame taught me a thing or two.
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfOnyxiaPlaysDontStandInTheFire_01	Watch your step!
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfOnyxiaPlaysScaleOfOnyxia_1_01	Destroy them!
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfOnyxiaPlaysScaleOfOnyxia_2_01	Feed, my children!
VO_BOM_10_006_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_HE_Custom_IfDawngraspPlaysDrakefireAmulet_01	You are an affront to the Dragonflights. They stand against you!
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01	No! This is not the end. Naaru -- save MEEEEEEE!
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_A	Onyxia is slain! Please, we must hurry to my Runi.
VO_BOM_10_006_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_B	The naaru is too big to travel through a portal. 
VO_BOM_10_006_Male_Human_Varian_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_C	Xyrella, Dawngrasp, take my fastest gryphons. Fly to the Exodar.
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	The time for cunning words has passed.
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_Death_01	<Death>
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	At last! Now, naaru, grant me the power to enslave this world!
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_BossIdle_01	Elves...humans...you mortal races are the greatest threat to dragonkind's survival.
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_BossIdle_02	I would do anything to protect my children. Anything! That is why I need the naaru.
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_BossIdle_03	I will bring down this cavern on your heads!
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	Blood and iron!
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	Lava and magic!
VO_BOM_10_006_Female_Dragon_Onyxia_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	Scales and fire!
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_07_01_A	<ROAR>
VO_BOM_10_007_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_07_01_B	Xyrella and I flew with all haste to her daughter, the broken naaru with us, when the broodmother burst through the top of her lair and gave chase. 
VO_BOM_10_007_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_07_01_C	Her broken body surged with void energy. In seconds the undead dragon was upon us.
VO_BOM_10_007_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Introduction_01_A	Xyrella! Keep flying. Don't stop!
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_Introduction_01_B	GIVE IT TO ME!
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_Turn_03_01_A	Abomination! How is this possible?
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_Turn_03_01_B	DID YOU THINK I WOULD HOLD THE VOID NAARU'S POWER AND NOT USE IT?!
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_Turn_03_01_C	LET THE CHASE BEGIN!
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfOnyxiaPlaysTailSweep_01	I'll sweep out the trash!
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfOnyxiaPlaysWingBuffet_01	My wings make storms!
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfOnyxiaPlaysBreathOfFire_1_01	Hot under the collar?
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfOnyxiaPlaysBreathOfFire_2_01	Bathe in fire!
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfOnyxiaPlaysBreathOfFire_3_01	You will BURN!
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfOnyxiaPlaysBellowingRoar_01	<ROAR>
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_HE_Custom_IfOnyxiaPlaysDeepBreath_01	Ready my flames!
VO_BOM_10_007_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_A	It's over. She's gone.
VO_BOM_09_007_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_B	The Exodar is just ahead. Come with me the rest of the way, Dawngrasp.
VO_BOM_09_007_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_C	You have been a true friend to see this through to the end.
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	<ROAR>
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_Death_01	<Death>
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	<ROAR>
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_BossIdle_01	HOLD STILL!
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_BossIdle_02	I WILL HAVE IT!
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_BossIdle_03	YOU AND ALL YOUR FRIENDS WILL SUFFER THE SAME FATE!
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	<ROAR>
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	SO MUCH POWER!
VO_BOM_10_007_Female_Dragon_UndeadOnyxia_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	I AM THE VOID!
VO_BOM_10_008_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_08_01_A	We reached the Exodar, the vessel that had brought Xyrella's people to Azeroth. Deep inside, we carefully laid out the shards of naaru into the shape of its being.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_08_01_B	The shards still burned with void energy, but my studies of the naaru had prepared me for this moment.
VO_BOM_10_004_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_08_01_C	Look, Dawngrasp! The naaru reforms...
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_Introduction_01_A	I am Mi'da...Pure Void...I...destroy.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_Introduction_01_B	We will restore you to the Light!
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_Turn_03_01	I cannot reform. My pieces -- destroyed. The demon's portal. The lich's birth. I...am...unstable.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_Turn_03_02	Echoes of memory...I was strewn across the world...I remember all I have seen.
VO_BOM_10_008_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_Turn_07_01	We have made such sacrifices to reach this point. Some have given everything for me to save Runi. Please.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_Turn_11_01_A	It is impossible.\nI am unwhole.\nI wither.
VO_BOM_10_008_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_Turn_11_01_B	No, please! I had a vision. You spoke to me.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_Turn_11_01_C	It is too late.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_HE_Custom_IfBossAt15Health_01_A	The purification -- I think it's working!
VO_BOM_10_008_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_A	The light returns!
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_B	I am Mi'da...Pure Light...
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_C	With the last flicker of my being, I...reforge your child...in Light...
VO_BOM_10_008_Female_Draenei_Runi_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_A	Mother...It's me. Where am I?
VO_BOM_10_008_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_B	I see you, my child. You are here. You are awake. At last. It is over.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_EmoteResponse_01	I am breaking apart.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_Death_01	<Death>
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_PlayerLoss_01	The Void claims us all...
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_BossIdle_01	Matters of the naaru are beyond your comprehension.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_BossIdle_02	I soon will be no more.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_BossIdle_03	I share your memories...
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_01	The dragons found my core...gathered me up...
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_02	The goblins took me to the iron tower on the black lake.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_03	That fearful dwarf corrupted me...
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_04	The dreaming elf made me a nightmare.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_05	I opened the way to the demon.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_06	There was still good in that warlock who broke my shard. Barely, but I felt it.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_07	The pirates stole me.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_08	The orcs and dwarves fought over me.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_09	The broodmother used me. She nearly tore me apart.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_10	And now, I am here, with one final task.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_Naaru_Mida_InGame_BossUsesHeroPower_11	I will give  you my light if I can.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_09_01_A	My racing heart slowed as mother and daughter embraced. The naaru was gone, but the draenei, at last, were together once again.
VO_BOM_10_008_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_09_01_B	I returned to Silvermoon and accepted the rank of Magister. The others had their own rewards, their own adventures, that carried them to the edges of our world and home to their hearths. 
VO_BOM_10_008_X_BloodElf_Dawngrasp_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_09_01_C	We ten mercenaries would never all be together again, yet the falling stars forever connected us in a constellation of heroes. And though our book was closed, another was about to open.
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Togwaggle_Emote_Play_01	Togwaggle be small and naive kobold.
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Togwaggle_Emote_Attack_01	You no hurt this one!
VO_BOM_09_004_Male_Kobold_Togwaggle_Emote_Death_01	<Death>
VO_BOM_10_001_Female_Orc_Rokara_Emote_Play_01	I am champion of the Frostwolves!
VO_BOM_10_001_Female_Orc_Rokara_Emote_Attack_01	Unstoppable!
VO_BOM_10_001_Female_Orc_Rokara_Emote_Death_01	<Death>

VO_BOM_09_008_Female_Draenei_Xyrella_Emote_Death_01	<Death>
VO_BOM_10_001_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_Emote_Play_01	After this, I don't want to hear the word "shard" ever again.

VO_BOM_10_001_Male_Gnome_Scabbs_Emote_Death_01	<Death>

VO_BOM_10_004_Male_Gnome_GuildLeader_Emote_Play_01	You are going to deal damage so slowly.
VO_BOM_10_004_Male_Gnome_GuildLeader_Emote_Attack_01	WATCH THAT TAIL!

VO_BOM_10_004_Male_Dragon_Kazakusan_Emote_Attack_03	Your end has come!
VO_BOM_10_004_Male_Dragon_Kazakusan_Emote_Attack_04	You will be devoured.
VO_BOM_10_004_Male_Dragon_Kazakusan_Emote_Attack_05	The time to create is over. Now I will destroy!
VO_BOM_10_008_Female_Draenei_Runi_Emote_Play_01	I awaken with the new dawn!
VO_BOM_10_008_Female_Draenei_Runi_Emote_Attack_01	I am born of light.

VO_Female_Gnome_Story_11_Ini_001hp_InGame_Introduction_01_01_b	I was under the impression you needed my submarine?
VO_Female_Gnome_Story_11_Ini_001hp_InGame_Turn_01_01_e	My ship, the Leviathan, is as good as they get. But we'll need another crewmember to staff it.
VO_Female_Human_Story_11_GracePrologue_InGame_HE_Custom_102_01_a	I've been sailing for as long as I can remember. Sea monsters, shipwrecks, mutinies... I've survived them all. Wherever you're headed, I'll get you there safely... as long as you uphold your end of the deal.
VO_Female_Human_Story_11_GracePrologue_InGame_HE_Custom_105_01_b	I won't let you down, ambassador. This crew seems a lot better than some of the others I've joined...
VO_Female_Nightborne_Story_11_Caye_012hp_InGame_HE_Custom_01	They are, ambassador. You're sure you want to go forward with this?
VO_Female_Nightborne_Story_11_Caye_012hp_InGame_HE_Custom_02	Then let's meet them.
VO_Female_Nightborne_Story_11_Caye_012hp_InGame_HE_Custom_101_01_a	You can read a little about them if you like.
VO_Female_Nightborne_Story_11_Caye_012hp_InGame_HE_Custom_102_01_b	I think she really needs the money. But her wits are sharp.
VO_Female_Nightborne_Story_11_Caye_012hp_InGame_HE_Custom_103_01_b	I feel like our crew will be quite jolly with him aboard.
VO_Female_Nightborne_Story_11_Caye_012hp_InGame_HE_Custom_104_01_b	He's a strong sort. I don't doubt he could hold his own in a battle.
VO_Female_Nightborne_Story_11_Caye_012hp_InGame_Turn_01_01_d	He will pay handsomely.
VO_Female_Nightborne_Story_11_Caye_012hp_InGame_Turn_01_01_f	I've brought a few recruits for you to choose from.
VO_Female_Nightborne_Story_11_Caye_012hp_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01_a	Now that we're settled, let's get underway.
VO_Male_BloodElf_Story_11_HalusPrologue_InGame_HE_Custom_104_01_a	In the days of my youth, I trained endlessly to gain the strength that would allow me to safeguard the innocent. No foe can withstand my conviction. As your motives appear to be pure, I will offer you my blade.
VO_Male_BloodElf_Story_11_HalusPrologue_InGame_HE_Custom_107_01_b	The pleasure is mine, ambassador. Who knows what we will encounter in the depths of the sea...
VO_Male_Murloc_Story_11_FinleyPrologue_InGame_HE_Custom_103_01_a	As a founding member of the League of Explorers, I am committed to exploring the far corners of the world! The farther, the better, I'd say! Visiting an underwater ruin sounds like my cup of tea.
VO_Male_Murloc_Story_11_FinleyPrologue_InGame_HE_Custom_106_01_b	Oh dear, I suppose you'll have to make do with just me this time.
VO_Male_Nightborne_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_InGame_HE_Custom_01	Ah, Stardusk! Is everyone ready?
VO_Male_Nightborne_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_InGame_HE_Custom_02	I've waited thousands of years for this day. I couldn't imagine delaying a moment more!
VO_Male_Nightborne_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_InGame_HE_Custom_105_01_a	Welcome aboard, Grace! I was looking for an experienced sailor, and here you are!
VO_Male_Nightborne_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_InGame_HE_Custom_106_01_a	Sir Finley is just the murloc for the job! I don't suppose the rest of the League is available for hire as well?
VO_Male_Nightborne_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_InGame_HE_Custom_107_01_a	Welcome to our crew, Halus! I'll feel a lot safer with you by my side.
VO_Male_Nightborne_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_InGame_Introduction_02_a	You may be wondering why I've gathered you here today. I must admit, it is quite the story...
VO_Male_Nightborne_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_InGame_Turn_01_01_b	I have many memories there... and things I left behind, not realizing it was forever.
VO_Male_Nightborne_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_InGame_Turn_01_01_c	But now I have the means to go back... with your help, of course.
VO_Male_Nightborne_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_InGame_Turn_01_02_a	Yes! Now that the borders of Suramar have opened, I am free to return to the land that is truly my home.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission1_01	It won't take much work to get the Leviathan ready. Just leave it to me!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission1_01	This is exciting! Would you believe it's my first time on a submarine?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission1_02	Actually, yes.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1Start_01	How do we start up the engines on this delightful contraption?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission1Start_01	Uh, this kinda thing requires a more technical mind, if you know what I mean. 
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1Start_02	Fascinating! I shall watch you work.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission1_Progress1_01	As the builder, I'm an expert in even the tiniest details of this vessel.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission1_Progress1_02	You gotta know which parts go where, and in what order!
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission1_Progress1_01	How do you keep track of all that?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission1_Progress1a_01	It's not too hard if you wrote the manual.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission1_Progress1_01	Somehow I have the feeling you're making this up as you go along.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission1_Progress1b_01	Shh, that's a secret!
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission1_Progress1_01	Ah, just like assembling an ancient statue!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission1_Progress1c_01	See? The murloc gets it.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1Progress2_01	Is everything progressing well? I can't quite follow it.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission1_Progress2_01	It's amazing. Spectacular.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1_Progress2_01	I think it's best not to bother her, ambassador.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission1_Progress3_01	This part's always easy unless the sub's on fire. Better not set it on fire.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission1_Progress4_01	And we're underway!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1Progress4_01	I can't believe it!
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1_Part2_01	There's a Suramar vessel on our tail... looks like a patrol ship.
VO_Story_11_Patrol_001hb_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1Part2_01	Unidentified vessel! Halt immediately!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1Part2_01	We can't turn back now!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission1_Part2_01	You heard the ambassador. To battlestations!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1ExchangeA_01	Don't sink them, just do enough damage to keep them from following us.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission1ExchangeA_01	You got it.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission1ExchangeA_01	An upstanding decision.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission1ExchangeA_01	I wouldn't dream of doing otherwise.
VO_Story_11_Patrol_001hb_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1ExchangeBa_01	You will be written up for this... whoever you are!
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission1ExchangeB_01	What they don't know can't hurt us.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission1ExchangeB_01	Would it help if we introduced ourselves?
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1ExchangeB_01	NO.
VO_Story_11_Patrol_001hb_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1ExchangeBc_01	I've never even seen a boat like this. How can I report it?
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission1ExchangeB_01	Those with little imagination can offer little insight.
VO_Story_11_Patrol_001hb_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1ExchangeEa_01	We're taking on water. We can't hold up much longer!
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission1ExchangeE_01	Serves you right.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1ExchangeE_01	They must not want anyone to explore these waters until the Grand Magistrix's officials do.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission1ExchangeE_01	Exploration is always a bit... competitive in my experience.
VO_Story_11_Patrol_001hb_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1ExchangeEb_01	You may drive us back, but there are other dangers! You don't know what's out there!
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission1ExchangeE_01	Isn't that the point?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1ExchangeEc_01	I like the way you think, Halus.
VO_Story_11_Patrol_001hb_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1Victory_01	We can't take any more damage. Retreat to port!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1Victory_01	We've done it!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission1Victory_01	Good job defending the Leviathan. We're in fine shape to forge ahead.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1Victory_01	I only hope our future trials end this well...
VO_Story_11_Patrol_001hb_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1EmoteResponse_01	Now you wish to talk?
VO_Story_11_Patrol_001hb_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1HeroPower_01	Tow them back!
VO_Story_11_Patrol_001hb_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1HeroPower_02	They won't get away!
VO_Story_11_Patrol_001hb_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1HeroPower_03	Obey the rule of law!
VO_Story_11_Patrol_001hb_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1Loss_01	The Grand Magistrix will have questions for you. I hope you're prepared to answer them.
VO_Story_11_Patrol_001hb_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1Idle_01	We just lowered the shield, and already people are causing so much trouble!
VO_Story_11_Patrol_001hb_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1Idle_02	What a strange vessel. I can't tell if it's made by goblins or gnomes or gnolls.
VO_Story_11_Patrol_001hb_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission1Idle_03	I promise, I'm a lot less of a threat to you than the Grand Magistrix will be...
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Attack_01	Nail it down!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Greetings_01	Hi there.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Well_Played_01	You're on top of things!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Wow_01	Ingenious!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Oops_01	Oops?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Threaten_01	You know I have a lot of power tools, right?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Thanks_01	Thanks!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Concede_01	I'm out.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Time_01	Time's ticking!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_LowCards_01	I'm low on cards!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_NoCards_01	All outta cards!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Error_Generic_01	Nope.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Error_Hand_Full_01	There isn't space!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission1_Lorebook_1_01	Based on the tradition of submergible vessels developed during the Second War, the Leviathan possesses many unique features. Its upgraded fusion core has proved remarkably stable in all instances--except for fires--and its mainframe interface has never been hacked, aside from the Stormcoil Override.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission1_Lorebook_2_01	Day 601: Still no passengers. Maybe I should have built a submarine with lower operating costs. But where's the fun in that? The Leviathan is worth every last gold coin they have. Surely SOMEONE will need to visit the bottom of the sea at some point? I mean, aside from me. I didn't become a top tinker to hang out in normal places.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission2_01	According to Faelin's old maps, we should be near the outer edge of the ruins by now.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission2_01	Actually, the topography's changed a lot since then. Aren't we—wait, something's coming!
VO_Story_11_Looter_002hb_Male_Undead_Story_Faelin_Mission2Start_01	Well, looky what we have here. A bunch of landlubbers be infringin' on me territory.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission2Start_01	Your territory? These are Suramar waters!
VO_Story_11_Looter_002hb_Male_Undead_Story_Faelin_Mission2Start_02	They belong to me, says I! And so will your cargo.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission2ExchangeA_01	Get ready for battle!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission2ExchangeA_01	We're encountering setbacks at every turn, aren't we?
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission2ExchangeA_01	Nothing I can't handle.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission2ExchangeA_01	Try not to worry. I'll worry enough for both of us!
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission2ExchangeA_01	Not for long.
VO_Story_11_Looter_002hb_Male_Undead_Story_Faelin_Mission2ExchangeC_01	I bet ye thought you were awful clever gettin' out here when the shield came down. But yer too late!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission2ExchangeC_01	A-are we?
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission2ExchangeC_01	Nonsense, ambassador. We'll defeat him in no time.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission2ExchangeG_01	I didn't realize we'd face so many obstacles so quickly!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission2ExchangeG_01	Hey, once we're at the bottom of the sea it should be nice and lonely.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission2ExchangeIa_01	I hope so.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission2ExchangeI_01	There is nothing worse than looters, in my experience. They have no respect for history!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission2ExchangeIb_01	I hope you don't think I'm a looter!
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission2ExchangeI_02	Certainly not! You cannot loot your past self, I think.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission2ExchangeI_01	Be patient. His courage will fail him, and our way forward will clear.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission2ExchangeIc_01	Nothing bothers you, does it?
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission2ExchangeI_02	It's not that. I just have larger challenges to focus on.
VO_Story_11_Looter_002hb_Male_Undead_Story_Faelin_Mission2Victory_01	Enough, enough! You've made yer point. We're up to our ears in water! 
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission2Victory_01	Serves you right. Don't cross our path again.
VO_Story_11_Looter_002hb_Male_Undead_Story_Faelin_Mission2Victory_02	Hmph. Everything here is thousands of years old anyway. Hardly of value.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission2Victory_01	It's really quite the opposite.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission2Victory_01	If only he knew the truth.
VO_Story_11_Looter_002hb_Male_Undead_Story_Faelin_Mission2EmoteResponse_01	You want to parley?
VO_Story_11_Looter_002hb_Male_Undead_Story_Faelin_Mission2HeroPower_01	The gold makes the rules!
VO_Story_11_Looter_002hb_Male_Undead_Story_Faelin_Mission2HeroPower_02	Follow the coin!
VO_Story_11_Looter_002hb_Male_Undead_Story_Faelin_Mission2HeroPower_03	No pennies for your loss!
VO_Story_11_Looter_002hb_Male_Undead_Story_Faelin_Mission2Loss_01	I always wanted me own submarine, heheh.
VO_Story_11_Looter_002hb_Male_Undead_Story_Faelin_Mission2Idle_01	Even sticky-fingered sea dogs gotta respect first dibs.
VO_Story_11_Looter_002hb_Male_Undead_Story_Faelin_Mission2Idle_02	Yer takin' too much of our time! We could be swimming in gold by now if ye hadn't shown up uninvited.
VO_Story_11_Looter_002hb_Male_Undead_Story_Faelin_Mission2Idle_03	We're takin' yer boat, but the gnome is goin' overboard with the rest of you!
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission2_Lorebook_1_01	The city of Zin-Azshari is named for our most glorious queen, Azshara. Her wisdom and power has guided the elves to new heights, and our peerless achievements have become the envy of all. Truly, ours shall be the brightest future.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission2_Lorebook_1_01	Were people really like that in your time?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission2_Lorebook_3_01	I'm afraid so. They hadn't a clue this would all be ruins one day.
VO_Story_11_FirstMatePip_Male_Vulpera_Story_Faelin_Mission2_Lorebook_2_01	The captain's been restless as of late. He's havin' strange dreams at night and won't tell me a thing. When I crept up on him last night, he was ramblin' about snake armies and a woman's voice calling him to find some relics. I'm thinkin' about deserting and becoming a gardener.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission3_01	All right, with that little nuisance out of the way, we're ready to dive deep!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission3_01	But look... isn't that the strange looter coming back?
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission3_01	I'm afraid that's not the looter...
VO_Story_11_Hooktusk_003hb_Female_Troll_Story_Faelin_Mission3Start_01	I, Captain Hooktusk, will be taking over command of this ship!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission3Start_01	We have to get out of here!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeA_01	Honestly, I'd be shocked if she could figure out the controls.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeA_01	Hey, do you even understand the controls?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeA_02	HUSH.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeB_01	Captain Hooktusk has a reputation on the high seas. She won't go easy on us.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeB_01	She has good taste in ships too, I'll give her that.
VO_Story_11_Hooktusk_003hb_Female_Troll_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeC_01	This will be a fine addition to my fleet.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeC_01	I will wreck it before I'll hand it over to you!
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeC_01	Don't be too hasty Ini.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeC_02	You have no idea how long I worked on this thing!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeD_01	Please, I really need this ship. 
VO_Story_11_Hooktusk_003hb_Female_Troll_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeD_01	For what?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeD_02	It's a personal matter.
VO_Story_11_Hooktusk_003hb_Female_Troll_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeD_02	You'll have to do better than that.
VO_Story_11_Hooktusk_003hb_Female_Troll_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeE_01	If you won't hand the ship over nicely, I'll just blast some holes in it!
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeE_01	Honestly, your plan doesn't make any sense.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeE_01	We're taking damage!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeF_01	It's not good. The Leviathan can't handle much more of this!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeG_01	Try and keep my ship in one piece, would ya?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission3ExchangeF_01	We're doing our best! 
VO_Story_11_Hooktusk_003hb_Female_Troll_Story_Faelin_Mission3Victory_01	Hah, you have tenacity, I'll give you that. Let me tell you one thing before I go. 
VO_Story_11_Hooktusk_003hb_Female_Troll_Story_Faelin_Mission3Victory_02	You should have given me the ship. What waits down there is not for the likes of you.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission3Victory_01	I don't know what she means.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission3Victory_01	Some people are terribly afraid of murlocs, you know. And I have lots of family in the region.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission3Victory_01	I think I might, but it is a tale for another time.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission3Victory_01	It's nothing. She's trying to scare us.
VO_Story_11_Hooktusk_003hb_Female_Troll_Story_Faelin_Mission3EmoteResponse_01	I could parlay all day.
VO_Story_11_Hooktusk_003hb_Female_Troll_Story_Faelin_Mission3HeroPower_01	I'll be taking this one.
VO_Story_11_Hooktusk_003hb_Female_Troll_Story_Faelin_Mission3HeroPower_02	Come aboard.
VO_Story_11_Hooktusk_003hb_Female_Troll_Story_Faelin_Mission3HeroPower_03	They'll pay a fine price.
VO_Story_11_Hooktusk_003hb_Female_Troll_Story_Faelin_Mission3Loss_01	Now I will rule the seas from top to trench, heheh.
VO_Story_11_Hooktusk_003hb_Female_Troll_Story_Faelin_Mission3Idle_01	I hate paperwork, so stealing's the only way I can get a submarine.
VO_Story_11_Hooktusk_003hb_Female_Troll_Story_Faelin_Mission3Idle_02	Your ship will take my piracy to a deeper level.
VO_Story_11_Hooktusk_003hb_Female_Troll_Story_Faelin_Mission3Idle_03	Sometimes I see things that were just meant to be mine. Like your ship or Rattleswipe's parrot.
VO_Story_11_Hooktusk_003hb_Female_Troll_Story_Faelin_Mission3_Lorebook_1_01	I was just going to pillage some new waters when I caught word that an even better ship was already there waiting to be commandeered. And best of all, it is crewed by amateurs! Hah! Sometimes I really am too lucky, even for me.
VO_Story_11_Mission3_Lorebook2_Female_Goblin_Story_Faelin_Mission3_Lorebook_2_01	We've been followin' the boat since Cap'n Hooktusk first gave the orders near Suramar. Cap'n says it's worth more than the lot of us! Never seen her want anything so bad since she swiped that shady parrot from ol' Rattleswipe back in the day.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission3_Lorebook_3_01	Our voyage is off to a rough start. The ambassador seems to be in his own world, and the crew is just trying to stay in one piece given all the pirates around us. Still, this could be the perfect chance to get retake what is mine... and settle that final score.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission4_01	Let's make our dive now, Stormcoil. Before anything else happens!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission4_01	About that... Hooktusk's crew banged up the Leviathan enough that we should make some repairs first.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission4_02	You can make them quickly, right?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission4_02	Absolutely!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission4Start_01	Now where did I leave my toolbox?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission4ExchangeA_01	Those stupid pirates... look what they did to my ship!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission4ExchangeB_01	I need that one thing that does the thing...
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission4ExchangeB_02	NOT that one.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission4ExchangeB_03	Yeah, that one!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission4ExchangeC_01	How did that get there?!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission4ExchangeD_01	Is everything all right?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission4ExchangeD_01	Yeah. Just awfully soggy in here. Blecch.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission4ExchangeE_01	Want a mop?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission4ExchangeE_01	NO.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission4Victory_01	You hear that? We are good to go!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission4Victory_01	I couldn't be more relieved!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission4Loss_01	Time to try again!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission4Loss_02	Hey, I just wanted to see what would happen if I did that.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission5a_01	I say, Stormcoil, isn't the engine a bit louder than before?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission5a_01	That isn't the engine...
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission5a_01	There's a storm coming, and it's headed straight for us!
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission5b_01	I've sighted another ship on the horizon. It has red sails and a strange figurehead... I can't make it out.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission5b_01	That sounds like more pirates!
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_PreMission5b_01	Not pirates. Listen to me: you have to follow that boat! I'm taking over!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission5aStart_01	Whatever shall we do?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission5aStart_01	Keep the water out of the ship! It's churning too much for us to dive!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission5aExchangeA_01	This is the largest storm I've ever seen!
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission5aExchangeA_01	It's not so bad compared to the plague lords.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission5aExchangeA_02	I'm afraid to ask!
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission5aExchangeA_01	But then, you have not traveled much.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission5aExchangeA_03	I never really had the opportunity, you see.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission5aExchangeB_01	The ship will not falter so long as I am standing!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission5aExchangeB_01	...I really like him.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission5aExchangeC_01	How much water can the Leviathan take in without sinking?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission5aExchangeC_01	Uh... slightly more than this... but not much.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission5aExchangeD_01	If you're able to drive the elementals back, now would be time!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission5aVictory_01	That was too close for comfort!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission5aVictory_01	You're telling me! Let's dive lower, where it's safe.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission5aVictory_01	I couldn't agree more!
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission5aVictory_01	You have a strange notion of safety.
VO_Story_11_FirstMatePip_Male_Vulpera_Story_Faelin_Mission5a_Lorebook_1_01	The storm clouds go on 'n on\nRaging o'er the ocean long\nScaring sailors from dusk to dawn\nWhat a cruel phenomenon!
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission5a_Lorebook_2_01	After years of working for him, I can tell when the ambassador is anxious. He probably wishes we were closer to our destination. I don't know if the others will understand his true motives... Perhaps I am still trying to understand them as well.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission5a_Lorebook_3_01	I say, that ambassador is a curious chap, although I'm getting to like him more and more. Though he claims he just wants to visit his homeland, I do wonder if there is something else going on. At times, I think I catch a slight sadness in his eye, either that or he's not accustomed to the smell of murlocs.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission5a_Lorebook_3_01	Oh dear, have I revealed so much?
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission5a_Lorebook_4_01	As I've gotten to know the ambassador, I've realized he is hiding something from us. There is a secret deep within his heart, and it will take a momentous change to bring it to the surface. Despite this, I still feel he has been pure in his motives—for he hides his secret from pain, not from the will to deceive.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission5a_Lorebook_4_01	I-is that true?
VO_Story_11_Hurricane_005hb_Male_Elemental_Story_Faelin_Mission5aDeath_01	<elemental roar>
VO_Story_11_Hurricane_005hb_Male_Elemental_Story_Faelin_Mission5aEmoteResponse_01	WHOOOOOSH!
VO_Story_11_Hurricane_005hb_Male_Elemental_Story_Faelin_Mission5aLoss_01	WHOOOOOOOOSH!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission5bExchangeA_01	Uh, Grace, what is going on here?!
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bStart_01	I have an old score to settle. Stay out of it.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission5bExchangeA_02	I'm kinda already involved?!
VO_Story_11_Nemesis_005hb_Male_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bStart_01	Well, well, if it isn't our former Captain Grace...
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bExchangeA_01	Hand over my ship, and I'll spare you the crushing humiliation of defeat!
VO_Story_11_Nemesis_005hb_Male_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bExchangeA_01	I'd love to, but the crew's gotten used to me now.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bExchangeB_01	I can't believe you're using my sword. You look ridiculous.
VO_Story_11_Nemesis_005hb_Male_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bExchangeB_01	But it's fun and sharp, even if the name's a bit unimaginative.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bExchangeB_02	Shut up!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission5bExchangeC_01	Does this mean... this was your old ship? And everyone on it used to work for you?!
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bExchangeC_01	You really know how to dig up old wounds, huh?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission5bExchangeC_02	I'm truly sorry, Grace.
VO_Story_11_Nemesis_005hb_Male_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bExchangeC_01	Do you really miss this sorry old boat that much?
VO_Story_11_Nemesis_005hb_Male_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bExchangeC_02	It seems like you found a much more loyal crew on that sub.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bExchangeD_01	What's mine is mine, traitor.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission5bExchangeE_01	Ini, we have to help!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission5bExchangeE_01	Don't worry, I'm on it.
VO_Story_11_Nemesis_005hb_Male_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bVictory_01	Hold up. Let's all just think things over for a moment, okay?
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bVictory_01	Oh, I've thought plenty. I want my ship back. And my crew. And my sword!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission5bVictory_01	You'd better listen to her!
VO_Story_11_Nemesis_005hb_Male_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bVictory_02	The sword is yours. And the ship and crew will be waiting at port when you're back.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bVictory_02	I'll hold you to your word.
VO_Story_11_Nemesis_005hb_Male_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bVictory_03	With your powerful friends behind you, I hardly have a choice.
VO_Story_11_Nemesis_005hb_Male_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bEmoteResponse_01	Let's talk through this.
VO_Story_11_Nemesis_005hb_Male_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bHeroPower_01	What a great sword!
VO_Story_11_Nemesis_005hb_Male_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bHeroPower_02	Recognize this?
VO_Story_11_Nemesis_005hb_Male_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bHeroPower_03	It's not getting rusty!
VO_Story_11_Nemesis_005hb_Male_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bLoss_01	Ouch. Did I go a little too hard on you?
VO_Story_11_Nemesis_005hb_Male_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bIdle_01	I had a good reason for all of this, I promise! Just hear me out...
VO_Story_11_Nemesis_005hb_Male_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bIdle_02	I didn't know you'd take everything so personally!
VO_Story_11_Nemesis_005hb_Male_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5bIdle_03	You might not believe this, but I didn't really want to do this at all.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Attack_01	Aggressive negotiations!
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Greetings_01	Hello.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Well_Played_01	I like your style.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Wow_01	Spectacular!
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Oops_01	What was that?
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Threaten_01	Hey, I have enough attitude for the both of us.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Thanks_01	Thanks!
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Concede_01	I know when I've lost.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Time_01	Not much time left...
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_LowCards_01	Getting low on cards.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_NoCards_01	I'm out of cards!
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Error_Generic_01	No.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Error_Hand_Full_01	Not enough room.
VO_Story_11_Mission5b_Lorebook1_Male_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5b_Lorebook_1_01	Acquire a ship and investigate the newly accessible perimeter of Suramar. Report your findings back as soon as possible. The Horde may be outmaneuvering us to make allies with the Nightborne. -M.S.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5b_Lorebook_1_01	What, is he some kind of spy or something? This is unbelievable.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission5b_Lorebook_2_01	Built in Stormwind, this merchant vessel has been in my family for two generations. Originally running between its home city and Lordaeron, it has expanded its routes to include nearly every ocean on Azeroth. With its bright red sails flying, it's completed nearly all of its shipments without incident... and even mostly on time.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission6_01	Finally, a moment of quiet.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission6_01	Well... I'm getting a message from the surface. It sounds like a distress call!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission6_01	We have to help them! Take us up!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission6_02	At this rate, we'll never get to the ruins... But you're right.
VO_Story_11_Captain_006hb_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6Start_01	Someone aid us, please! Our ship is sinking!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission6Start_01	What can we do?!
VO_Story_11_Captain_006hb_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6Start_02	Help me evacuate everyone while there's still time!
VO_Story_11_Captain_006hb_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6ExchangeA_01	We're a merchant crew, but we have passengers as well. 
VO_Story_11_Captain_006hb_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6ExchangeA_02	Please save them. I think everyone's on the verge of panic.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission6ExchangeA_01	I certainly would be!
VO_Story_11_Captain_006hb_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6ExchangeB_01	The people come first, but if you can rescue any cargo, then I'll try to reward you.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6ExchangeB_01	A reward sounds pretty good...
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission6ExchangeB_01	I wouldn't mind a treasure or two...
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission6ExchangeB_01	Doing what's right is reward enough.
VO_Story_11_Captain_006hb_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6ExchangeC_01	We were following our normal route when a storm came out of nowhere and blew us off course.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission6ExchangeC_01	You're lucky it wasn't worse!
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission6ExchangeC_01	We saw it too.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6ExchangeC_01	That's happened to me a time or two. But I never ended up out here!
VO_Story_11_Captain_006hb_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6ExchangeD_01	In all my time sailing, I've never seen this place...
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission6ExchangeD_01	You are above the ruins of the ancient city of Zin-Azshari.
VO_Story_11_Captain_006hb_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6ExchangeD_02	I... don't have time to ask you what that means.
VO_Story_11_Captain_006hb_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6Victory_01	Thank you all so much. We've deployed the lifeboats and boarded all survivors.
VO_Story_11_Captain_006hb_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6Victory_02	Without your intervention, this would have been a bitter day.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission6Victory_01	We did what anyone would have. Do take care as you head back.
VO_Story_11_Captain_006hb_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6Victory_03	I will.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6Victory_01	You're always helping people, just as you helped me.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6Victory_02	I wasn't sure what to make of you at first, but I am glad we joined together.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission6Victory_02	As am I, Grace.
VO_Story_11_Captain_006hb_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6EmoteResponse_01	I can't talk now!
VO_Story_11_Captain_006hb_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6Loss_01	I never imagined it could end like this...
VO_Story_11_Captain_006hb_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6Idle_01	Please save as many as you can. They didn't deserve this!
VO_Story_11_Captain_006hb_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6Idle_02	My crew means everything to me. If only I'd known a storm would come.
VO_Story_11_Captain_006hb_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6Idle_03	I will go down with my ship if I must.
VO_Story_11_Captain_006hb_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6_Lorebook_1_01	Our voyage started smoothly enough as we embarked from Stormwind to Valiance Keep in Northrend. Just as we passed the halfway point, a tremendous hurricane appeared out of nowhere, driving us into unknown waters and damaging the boat beyond repair.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission6_Lorebook_2_01	I wonder why the ambassador never told us exactly why he wanted to return... Could he be hiding something? Is he clever enough to hide something? That associate of his, Caye, sure seems to be. I hope I can trust them.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission6_Lorebook_2_01	Me? Of course I'm trustworthy!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission6_Lorebook_2_02	Then why are you reading my stuff?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission6_Lorebook_2_02	Oh, excuse me.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission6_Lorebook_3_01	Faelin really came through for me. I wasn't sure if I could trust him given his recklessness, and the whole impractical "I have to return home" thing... but there's a lot more to him than I first realized. Whenever he needs me, I know I'll be there.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission7_01	Well, I'm glad that's over. Caye, how are things looking below us?
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission7_01	Totally calm. We are clear to descend.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission7_02	Huh. That's odd. Things haven't been calm since we set out. I wonder what that means?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission7Start_01	Is that... a... 
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission7Start_01	OH MY SPROCKETS!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission7ExchangeA_01	W-we have to get away from it!
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission7ExchangeA_01	We're already caught. The engine can't repel something this large.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission7ExchangeB_01	That's it! I'm going out there myself.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission7ExchangeC_01	As soon as we strike down one part, another takes over!
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission7ExchangeC_01	Maybe we can hurt it enough that it backs down.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission7ExchangeE_01	I'd strike up a conversation, but my "kraken" is a bit rusty.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission7ExchangeC_01	If we are patient, the right moment will come.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission7ExchangeD_01	I'm doing all I can out here. Only one leviathan is coming out of this in one piece!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission7ExchangeD_01	That's the spirit!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission7Victory_01	All right, everyone but the ambassador get out here!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission7Victory_02	On the count of three... one... two... three!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission7Victory_01	You've done it... you really have... but wait, where is my amulet?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission7Victory_03	Look for it once we're outta here!
VO_Story_11_Ozumat_007hb_Male_Beast_Story_Faelin_Mission7Death_01	RAAAAAAARRRRGGGGH!
VO_Story_11_Ozumat_007hb_Male_Beast_Story_Faelin_Mission7EmoteResponse_01	RAAAAAAAAAARRR!
VO_Story_11_Ozumat_007hb_Male_Beast_Story_Faelin_Mission7Loss_01	RAAAAAARRR!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission7_Lorebook_1_01	I'll read this one! Hm... "Beware the... something? Under the waves. In the eternal uh, BIG SMUDGE, the can't-make-that-out waits for the unwary. Her is the kingdom of D-O-O..." oh, it's probably not important anyway.
VO_Story_11_Mission7_Lorebook2_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission7_Lorebook_2_01	Though fortune has not seen fit to let me explore the depths, I have heard tale of many formidable creatures, including the mighty Ozumat. It is said that this kraken has been corrupted by dark forces, adding to its immense power.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission7_Lorebook_2_01	Why, that's written by Elise Starseeker! I'm chuffed to bits!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission8_01	Bad news, everyone. We're not getting outta here. The Leviathan's got more holes than a goblin's 10-year warranty. 
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission8_01	How long will it take to fix?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission8_02	Your guess is as good as mine. But I'd better get to it.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission8_01	Has anyone seen my amulet?!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission8Start_01	If everyone keeps ABSOLUTELY quiet so I can concentrate, maybe I'll save the ship before we all sink.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission8Start_01	I'm really very concerned about the amulet.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission8Start_02	<sighs>
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission8ExchangeA_01	Oh dear, oh dear... where could it be?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission8ExchangeA_01	I said ABSOLUTELY QUIET.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission8ExchangeB_01	It takes a real monster to sabotage the Leviathan like this.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission8ExchangeC_01	I'll have to calibrate my tools to set things right here.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission8_Reaction_01	Nope.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission8_Reaction_02	Wrong configuration.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission8_Reaction_03	Nada. 
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission8_Reaction_04	That's it!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission8_Reaction_05	BINGO!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission8ExchangeD_01	THINK Stormcoil... THINK!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission8ExchangeE_01	Agh, sometimes I wish they WERE talking so I didn't have to hear myself think.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission8ExchangeF_01	Whoa, what is this amulet doing here?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission8ExchangeF_01	You found it! My most prized possession...
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission8Victory_01	Leviathan's patched up and good to go! But I've gotta ask—why is this amulet so important?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission8Victory_01	It was given to me by my closest friend, just as I became an ambassador... long ago. 
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission8Victory_02	Wow, he must be pretty smug about how much you still like it.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission8Victory_02	No... that's impossible.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission8_Loss_01	I'm just developing strategies.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission8_Loss_02	Try and try again I always say... when I have time... which is never.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission9a_01	Faelin's old maps don't match the terrain here.... I'm worried we've made a wrong turn.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission9a_01	I don't recognize anything anymore. The world I knew has vanished.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission9a_01	Did you uh, know any murlocs though? 'Cause that one seems real angry with us.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_PreMission9b_01	I say, friends, didn't we lose some supplies while fighting that kraken?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission9bStart_01	My apologies. It was me as well—I'm a bit of a nervous snacker.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_PreMission9b_02	Nothing to worry about! I have some relations nearby. Let's drop in! I think I also left something rather important there...
VO_Story_11_Murloc_009hb_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9aStart_01	Mrglrglargrrlarggg!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission9aStart_01	I don't know how this happened, but the Leviathan is covered in murlocs!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission9aStart_01	Get out there and shoo them away!
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission9aExchangeA_01	Ah, I was just thinking our menu could use a catch of the day!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission9aExchangeAa_01	Grace, this is serious! We have important work to do!
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission9aExchangeB_01	What's the best way to season a murloc? Sea salt and a little fish oil?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission9aExchangeBa_01	I won't eat anything that talks!
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission9aExchangeC_01	What if we dried the meat and called it Murky Jerky?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission9aExchangeCa_01	I've lost my appetite!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission9aExchangeC_01	I'd try it.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission9aExchangeD_01	I wonder what drew them to the Leviathan.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission9aExchangeD_01	Maybe they think it's a relative?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission9aExchangeD_02	Given how they're gnawing at it, maybe they think it's a snack!
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission9aExchangeD_01	I can relate. I'm hungry too.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission9aExchangeD_01	Ridiculous.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission9aExchangeE_01	These murlocs are no great danger, but they may alert worse enemies to our position.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission9aExchangeE_01	That's a good point.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission9aExchangeF_01	How is the Leviathan holding up, Ini?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission9aExchangeF_01	My repairs were solid. It can take a few hits from some fish.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission9aExchangeG_01	Do you truly recognize nothing of these surroundings, ambassador?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission9aExchangeG_01	I wish I could… but it's all so different now. We'll have to explore everything.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission9aVictory_01	Goodness, that was trying, though we prevailed.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission9aVictory_01	May we always be so blessed.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission9aVictory_02	I wouldn't go that far.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission9aVictory_01	Who's ready for lunch?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission9aVictory_01	Ugh.
VO_Story_11_Murloc_009hb_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9aLoss_01	Mrrglrrglraar!
VO_Story_11_Murloc_009hb_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9aEmoteResponse_01	Mrgalrgarrgl!
VO_Story_11_Murloc_009hb_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9aDeath_01	Aggh!
VO_Story_11_Mission9a_Lorebook1_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission9a_Lorebook_1_01	The ubiquitous murloc proves a loyal kitchen standby on the open seas. Freshly caught, it can make a passable sashimi or poke, but you can also hide any off flavors by putting it in a spicy seafood stew. No one will believe you if you say it's tuna though.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9a_Lorebook_1_01	It has been one of my chief regrets that the murloc scholarship remains in its infancy. Though other species may take a reductive view of us, murlocs are a highly varied and complex group that has consistently adapted to suit their environments—from freshwater lakes to the bottom of the sea.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bStart_01	Ahh, cousin Errgl! Lovely to see you visit us. I don't suppose you still have my compass?
VO_Story_11_Errgl_009hb_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bStart_01	Uh huh!
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bStart_02	There's a good chap. Give it back now…
VO_Story_11_Errgl_009hb_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bStart_02	Huh? NUH UH!
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bExchangeA_01	Oh for the love of cod. I think he's claimed it for his own.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission9bExchangeA_01	What do we do?
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bExchangeA_02	Help me scold him a bit. That should do it.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bExchangeB_01	Don't worry, you won't hurt him. He's quite tough.
VO_Story_11_Errgl_009hb_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bExchangeB_01	<indignant murloc sounds>
VO_Story_11_FinleysMum_Female_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bExchangeC_01	Gracious me! What is going on here?
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bExchangeC_01	Oh hello mum! It's just a little tussle with Errgl, you know how it can be with him…
VO_Story_11_FinleysMum_Female_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bExchangeC_02	Mind your manners, wouldn't you? He hardly ever gets to see you.
VO_Story_11_FinleysDad_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bExchangeD_01	Listen to your mum, my boy!
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bExchangeD_01	Ah, it's dad… how delightful.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission9bExchangeD_01	It's your whole family!
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bExchangeE_01	I'm afraid that just this once I must insist on having my way.
VO_Story_11_Errgl_009hb_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bExchangeE_01	<murloc tantrum>
VO_Story_11_FinleysMum_Female_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bVictory_01	Now, now, that's enough roughhousing. Errgl, give Finley his compass.
VO_Story_11_Errgl_009hb_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bVictory_01	<murloc 'no'>
VO_Story_11_FinleysDad_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bVictory_01	We'll send you back to the Abyssal Depths for summer school…
VO_Story_11_Errgl_009hb_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bVictory_02	Awww...
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bVictory_01	Ah, family. I missed you all so much. And now I must be going! 
VO_Story_11_FinleysMum_Female_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bVictory_02	But you only just arrived!
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bVictory_02	Take care now! Also I, uh, took the salted herring.
VO_Story_11_Errgl_009hb_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bEmoteResponse_01	<rude murloc sounds>
VO_Story_11_Errgl_009hb_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bHeroPower_01	Ooo!
VO_Story_11_Errgl_009hb_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bHeroPower_02	Ahhh!
VO_Story_11_Errgl_009hb_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bHeroPower_03	Ahaaa!
VO_Story_11_Errgl_009hb_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bLoss_01	Nyah nyah! Hahaha!
VO_Story_11_Errgl_009hb_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bIdle_01	Hmmmrgrlgl...
VO_Story_11_Errgl_009hb_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bIdle_02	Hahahamrglrlgha!
VO_Story_11_Errgl_009hb_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9bIdle_03	<pondering murloc sounds>
VO_Story_11_FinleysDad_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9b_Lorebook_1_01	We Mrrgltons are just your ordinary murloc family. We live in the sunny kelp forest next to some ruins that so delighted our young son, Finley, that he decided to become an explorer! Awfully proud of that little guy, heh. Just wish we got to see more of him.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission9b_Lorebook_2_01	This is no ordinary device, but a uniquely enchanted artifact that will help me in my travels. Because of this, it's very valuable and likely to be stolen if I cart it around Azeroth with me. Kindly look after it well, and don't let Cousin Errgl chew on it when he drops in. My thanks!
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission10a_01	Let's continue through the ruins slowly. Maybe we'll see something the ambassador recognizes.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission10a_01	I think that area to the east looks familiar…
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission10a_01	The one surrounded by naga?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission10a_02	Yes, that's it.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_PreMission10b_01	At last, we have reached the ruins that I sought. While the crew is resting, I will not be missed. 
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_PreMission10b_02	If I slip away for this moment, it will mean nothing to them, and everything to me.
VO_Story_11_NagaGuard_010hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission10aStart_01	What are you surface filth doing here?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission10aStart_01	Why, I'm on my way home!
VO_Story_11_NagaGuard_010hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission10aStart_02	Lie at your peril, you scum.
VO_Story_11_NagaGuard_010hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission10aExchangeA_01	We'll slice away at your little ship and see how long your story lasts.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission10aExchangeA_01	The ship… Why do they always gotta go after the ship?!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission10aExchangeA_01	I am telling the truth! This was once an ancient elven city…
VO_Story_11_NagaGuard_010hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission10aExchangeB_01	Do not speak to me of the elves. You do not even look as they once did.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission10aExchangeC_01	Time has changed my appearance. But my heart still belongs here.
VO_Story_11_NagaGuard_010hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission10aExchangeC_01	Then you will die here!
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission10aExchangeC_01	He most certainly will not! 
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission10aExchangeD_01	Should we withdraw, ambassador?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission10aExchangeD_01	I can't turn back now… not when I'm so close!
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission10aExchangeE_01	I say, I hope it wasn't my little family dustup that drew them here.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission10aExchangeE_01	Don't blame yourself. Family matters are often complicated.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission10aExchangeF_01	If the naga are already onto us, this is going to get tricky.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission10aExchangeF_01	They must have a stronghold nearby.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission10aExchangeF_02	Exactly. 
VO_Story_11_NagaGuard_010hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission10aVictory_01	The others will end this…
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission10aVictory_01	Does he mean us?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission10aVictory_01	It doesn't matter now. We're nearly there.
VO_Story_11_NagaGuard_010hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission10aEmoteResponse_01	We have nothing to discuss.
VO_Story_11_NagaGuard_010hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission10aDeath_01	Uggh!
VO_Story_11_NagaGuard_010hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission10aHeroPower_01	Aggh!
VO_Story_11_NagaGuard_010hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission10aHeroPower_02	You are out of your element!
VO_Story_11_NagaGuard_010hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission10aHeroPower_03	Failure beckons!
VO_Story_11_NagaGuard_010hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission10aLoss_01	Bring them to Zainra. She will be most pleased.
VO_Story_11_NagaGuard_010hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission10aIdle_01	Are all land dwellers so foolish?
VO_Story_11_NagaGuard_010hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission10aIdle_02	You will be food for the fish when I am done with you!
VO_Story_11_NagaGuard_010hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission10aIdle_03	You are nothing more than trespassers.
VO_Story_11_Mission10a_Lorebook1_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10a_Lorebook_1_01	Anyone found aiding or abetting the resistance efforts of Jarod Shadowsong, Malfurion Stormrage, and Tyrande Whisperwind or their co-conspirators will face swift and brutal punishment, including imprisonment or execution. Issued on order from her highness, the Light of Lights, Queen Azshara.
VO_Story_11_Mission10a_Lorebook2_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10a_Lorebook_2_01	After the resistance forces triumphed over Queen Azshara's demons, the Sundering began. This cataclysmic force destroyed the palace in Zin-Azshari, sending all of its inhabitants to the bottom of the sea. Somehow, they did not perish… but instead transformed into grotesque naga, allowing them to survive underwater.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission10a_Lorebook_2_01	Elise's scholarship is second to none!
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission10a_Lorebook_3_01	Dear Faelin, I thought the written word would be the best possible way to convey my gratitude. I know it wasn't easy enduring our little family reunion, but your intervention truly made all the difference. I trust we shall be fast friends no matter what lies ahead!
VO_Story_11_Nemesis_005hb_Male_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission10a_Lorebook_3_01	Grace, I hope this message finds you well—or finds you at all now that I've thrown it into the sea... I just wanted to apologize to you again. I wish I could explain further but let me just say you've done a valuable service to the Kingdom of Stormwind. If we meet again, let it be as friends.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission10a_Lorebook_4_01	I still can't believe this. But I guess I should? A royal connection could be useful when this is over.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bStart_01	Legend holds that warriors who defeat this statue are greater than any other—truly pure of heart.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bStart_02	I will take my place among them. Statue, awaken! Let the trial begin!
VO_Story_11_EnchantedStatue_010hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bStart_01	You face this challenge by your own free will?
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bStart_03	I do.
VO_Story_11_EnchantedStatue_010hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bExchangeA_01	Those who falter will be forever lost.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bExchangeA_01	I cannot fail!
VO_Story_11_EnchantedStatue_010hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bExchangeB_01	This test requires both strength and heart.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bExchangeB_01	Let me show you my prowess! 
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bExchangeC_01	I trained for so long… but I am still at my limit… What could I be missing?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission10bExchangeD_01	Halus!! Halus, wait for us!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission10bExchangeD_01	Why'd ya have to run off like that!
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bExchangeD_01	You came to aid me?
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission10bExchangeD_01	It is unwise to fight alone.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bExchangeE_01	I see now. My own strength was limited, but together our potential is endless.
VO_Story_11_EnchantedStatue_010hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bVictory_01	There can be strength in just one, but the heart needs others to truly thrive. You have passed my test.
VO_Story_11_EnchantedStatue_010hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bVictory_02	Use this gift in service to your friends, and your light will never fade.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bVictory_01	I am humbled.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission10bVictory_01	I don't know what all that meant… but congratulations, Halus!
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bVictory_02	Thank you, ambassador. I will never forget your kindness.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Attack_01	Prepare your defense!
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Greetings_01	Hello.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Well_Played_01	You fight boldly.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Wow_01	I stand amazed!
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Oops_01	That was improper.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Threaten_01	The sun can warm you or burn you…
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Thanks_01	Well, thanks!
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Concede_01	That is all.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Time_01	My time is short.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_LowCards_01	I am low on cards.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_NoCards_01	All out of cards!
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Error_Generic_01	No.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Error_Hand_Full_01	Not enough space.
VO_Story_11_EnchantedStatue_010hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bEmoteResponse_01	Speak with wisdom.
VO_Story_11_EnchantedStatue_010hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bHeroPower_01	What can you withstand?
VO_Story_11_EnchantedStatue_010hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bHeroPower_02	I will determine your merit.
VO_Story_11_EnchantedStatue_010hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bHeroPower_03	Are you worthy?
VO_Story_11_EnchantedStatue_010hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bLoss_01	There are many who failed. They did not yet understand.
VO_Story_11_EnchantedStatue_010hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bIdle_01	Before the Sundering, many would come. Now it is only you.
VO_Story_11_EnchantedStatue_010hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bIdle_02	Do the elves still speak of my trial? I wonder how many remember me.
VO_Story_11_EnchantedStatue_010hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10bIdle_03	My stone eyes see all. There is nothing you can hide from me.
VO_Story_11_EnchantedStatue_010hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10b_Lorebook_1_01	Though many of Elune's devoted are strong warriors, there is still no ultimate test of their abilities. The High Priestess has given me permission to create a trial that will determine the limits of their spiritual, as well as physical, fortitude. Perhaps if we locate it in Zin-Azshari, we will get more recruits.
VO_Story_11_EnchantedStatue_010hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission10b_Lorebook_2_01	Long years have passed since Queen Azshara or any of her heralds saw fit to visit our temple in Suramar. I think the High Priestess suspects much she cannot say. The last gift from the palace was a large crystal that I have been granted to use in my warrior's trial. 
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission11_01	I see it! The place I was looking for!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission11_01	You're saying we came all the way here to visit that pile of rocks?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission11_02	That is what remains of House Evenlar, the home of my dearest friend.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission11Start_01	When I was a young lad, Dathril Evenlar was always by my side. Together, it seemed like the whole world would be ours! 
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission11ExchangeA_01	Let me think back to those times…
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission11ExchangeB_01	I never realized that would be our last meeting.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission11Scene_01	Faelin, there's something we must discuss.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission11_Scene_01	Ah yes, our next prank? Heheh.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission11Scene_02	No, it's something serious. I have appointed you as ambassador to Suramar.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission11_Scene_02	Suramar? But I'll never see you!
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission11Scene_03	You haven't been paying attention, Faelin. There is violence just outside the city. 
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission11Scene_04	Strange creatures are running around. The resistance is trying to stop them, and the palace is trying to stop the resistance.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission11_Scene_03	I don't care about all that.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission11Scene_05	Please go. And take this amulet. I'll follow when I can.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission11_Scene_04	I went to Suramar. But Dathril remained in Zin-Azshari for days later—when the Sundering began…
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission11ExchangeA_01	I must hold on until Zainra returns. Then we can leave together!
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission11ExchangeB_01	Is Faelin worried for me in Suramar, I wonder?
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission11ExchangeC_01	What horrible power was the Queen dealing with?
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission11ExchangeD_01	So the palace reports were right… this is the end.
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission11ExchangeE_01	Why are you wasting time here? We must get to the palace!
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission11ExchangeE_01	They cannot be trusted! We should head to Suramar.
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission11ExchangeE_02	No. Our family is sworn to Azshara, little brother. Her fate will be ours.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission11_Scene_05	My dear friend. At long last, I will return this amulet to you.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission11Victory_01	Thank you so much, Dathril. Thank you for everything.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Attack_01	<attack exertion>
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Greetings_01	Ishnu'alah.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Well_Played_01	Well fought.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Wow_01	Incredible!
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Oops_01	Ugh.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Threaten_01	I will bring pride to House Evenlar.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Thanks_01	Thank you.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Concede_01	I give up.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Time_01	There's little time.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_LowCards_01	I am low on cards.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_NoCards_01	No more cards!
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Error_Generic_01	No.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Error_Hand_Full_01	I do not have room.
VO_Story_11_Mission11_Lorebook1_Male_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission11_Lorebook_1_01	It has come to our attention that the people of Suramar are restless and wish to receive more updates from the palace. Kindly appoint a new ambassador, someone well-connected but agreeable, and send them to us at once. When placated, I assure you the people will be easily managed.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission11_Lorebook_2_01	Faelin, I just want you to know I miss you already. But you have to believe me when I tell you that Zin-Azshari is no longer the same. Something is wrong and no one will see it. Your safety means everything to me, even if we must be apart for a while. Hopefully it is not too long.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission11_Lorebook_3_01	I was slow to see it, but the statue's wisdom has become my new guiding star. Now that my awareness is heightened, I realize the bonds between people are as strong as any blade, though they may still break if neglected. It falls to me to preserve the friendship between the crew, no matter what may test us.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission12_01	Psst, Caye!
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission12_01	What?
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission12_02	I don't want to spoil the moment, but I think someone's here…
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission12Start_01	Show yourself!
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission12Start_01	Do you not recognize my voice? I suppose it has been many years since you heard it last.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission12Start_02	Dathril! It cannot be! Oh bless you for saving me, I owe you my whole long life! How did you survive?
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission12ExchangeA_01	Those of us loyal to the queen were saved… but changed. Everything has changed.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission12ExchangeA_01	Dathril, no! Why are you attacking us?!
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission12ExchangeA_02	Those who dwell on the surface are our sworn enemies.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission12ExchangeB_01	I can't do it. I can't fight you!
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission12ExchangeB_01	Ambassador! I will take over.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission12ExchangeD_01	I tried to turn you away at every possible moment. But you were undeterred by all the foes you faced…
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission12ExchangeC_01	This cannot be happening.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission12ExchangeE_01	It was always going to happen. With my sister in the palace, I could never change sides.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission12ExchangeE_01	I cannot watch…
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission12ExchangeE_01	This is a fight we can't win, ambassador.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission12ExchangeE_01	I am sorry, old chap.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission12ExchangeF_01	He laid his trap too well.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission12Victory_01	You will come with me to the palace dungeon.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission12Victory_01	Please… I beg you…
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission12Victory_02	If there was any other way, you know I would have chosen it.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission12EmoteResponse_01	You still sound so familiar.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission12HeroPower_01	No turning back.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission12HeroPower_02	The dungeon awaits.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission12HeroPower_03	You are our prisoner.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission12Loss_01	I am sorry, old friend.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission12Idle_01	I never forgot the old days either. But the idylls of youth were short.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission12Idle_02	My greatest wish was to never see you again.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission12Idle_03	You're still so hopeful and quick to laugh. I didn't think I'd start to hate that about you.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission12_Lorebook_1_01	No matter how many tricks you play on me, or how many times we get in trouble…
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission12_Lorebook_1_01	Or how many times I forget your birthday, or don't answer your letters… 
VO_Story_11_Dathril_011hp_Male_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission12_Lorebook_1_02	We'll always be friends forever. 
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission12_Lorebook_1_02	Friends forever!
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_NightElf_Story_Faelin_Mission12_Lorebook_1_01	House Evenlar is an ancient family with close connections to the queen. It is said there's always an Evenlar among Azshara's royal retinue, much to our pride. On the... other side of the family, we also have a relative in the Temple of Elune in Suramar, which came as quite a surprise to the rest of us.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Attack_01	For the ambassador!
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Greetings_01	Well met.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Well_Played_01	A fine play.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Wow_01	I am astounded!
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Oops_01	What?
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Threaten_01	I will do anything to protect the ambassador.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Thanks_01	Thank you.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Concede_01	We will try again.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Time_01	Running out of time!
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_LowCards_01	I am low on cards.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_NoCards_01	No more cards!
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Error_Generic_01	No.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Error_Hand_Full_01	I do not have room.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission13_01	It is hopeless. We are lost.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission13_01	I can't believe your old friend locked us up! What a jerk. Are you sure your memory didn't get twisted over all those years?
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission13_01	Ini, please. The ambassador has been through enough.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission13_02	Then let's find a way out of here. I bet the jailor has something that could work…
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission13Start_01	I'll get the jailor's attention. Hey! Over here, you overgrown mollusk!
VO_Story_11_AbyssalJailor_013hb_Male_Faceless_Story_Faelin_Mission13Start_01	Annihilation…
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission13ExchangeA_01	Uh, he's definitely focused on us now…
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission13ExchangeA_01	Wow, your tactical genius is staggering.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission13ExchangeA_01	Enough, you two!
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission13ExchangeB_01	We'll have to work together to make up for Faelin.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission13ExchangeB_01	The ambassador's spirits are too low. We must rise to this challenge ourselves.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission13ExchangeB_01	There is no chance.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission13ExchangeB_02	I'm well aware of your perspective.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission13ExchangeC_01	You need not worry. I learned much from the statue.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission13ExchangeD_01	Let's all pitch in while Faelin takes a little, uh, breather.
VO_Story_11_AbyssalJailor_013hb_Male_Faceless_Story_Faelin_Mission13ExchangeD_01	Rebellion is hopeless…
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission13ExchangeD_01	That thing sounds like the ambassador!
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission13ExchangeE_01	Keep wearing him down. We're gaining ground!
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission13ExchangeF_01	You don't need to tell me twice.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission13ExchangeE_01	Hope isn't completely lost. It just takes its sweet time to find us. Like when I was getting my ship back.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission13Victory_01	I can't believe we pulled that off!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission13Victory_01	Now we can get to the important part: finding the Leviathan!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission13Victory_01	Impossible. The palace is huge… we will get caught.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission13Victory_01	Not with my compass to steer us along carefully!
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission13Victory_01	I'm willing to take that chance.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission13Victory_01	I will worry about that. You must heal your heart.
VO_Story_11_Mission13_Lorebook1_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission13_Lorebook_1_01	Scholars and officials may tell you one thing, but I know the truth. There is only one law in all of Zin-Azshari, and that is to please the queen. Should you violate that law, you may find yourself… here.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission13_Lorebook_2_01	Will they ever release me, I wonder? The Queen knows my true feelings, I'm certain of it. But my family may still be on my side. If they intervene for me, they will risk everything… Even my friend must think the world of me, never seeing the truth. In pleasing everyone, I have only betrayed them all.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission13_Lorebook_2_01	Who wrote this, I wonder?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Play_01	It is simply no use.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Attack_01	Leave me!
VO_Story_11_AbyssalJailor_013hb_Male_Faceless_Story_Faelin_Mission13EmoteResponse_01	Silence…
VO_Story_11_AbyssalJailor_013hb_Male_Faceless_Story_Faelin_Mission13HeroPower_01	Hopelessness…
VO_Story_11_AbyssalJailor_013hb_Male_Faceless_Story_Faelin_Mission13HeroPower_02	Fear…
VO_Story_11_AbyssalJailor_013hb_Male_Faceless_Story_Faelin_Mission13HeroPower_03	Isolation…
VO_Story_11_AbyssalJailor_013hb_Male_Faceless_Story_Faelin_Mission13Loss_01	Your futile ploy ends here.
VO_Story_11_AbyssalJailor_013hb_Male_Faceless_Story_Faelin_Mission13Idle_01	Your time runs out…
VO_Story_11_AbyssalJailor_013hb_Male_Faceless_Story_Faelin_Mission13Idle_02	None escape us…
VO_Story_11_AbyssalJailor_013hb_Male_Faceless_Story_Faelin_Mission13Idle_03	The depths will engulf you.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission14_01	I guess no one ever told you this, but you don't build a priceless, one-of-a-kind machine without putting a tracking device on it.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission14_01	Ini, you're incredible!
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission14_02	I know. The Leviathan's right this way. Just keep quiet and I'll get things up and running in no time.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission14Start_01	Oh for the love of cogs, what happened!
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission14ExchangeA_01	Is it that bad?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission14ExchangeA_01	It always is.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission14ExchangeA_01	Be quiet, I'm concentrating.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission14ExchangeB_01	Are we going to be able to use it?
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission14ExchangeB_01	But can it be used again?
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission14ExchangeB_01	We need to use it quickly.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission14ExchangeB_01	Quiet. Use the quiet.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission14ExchangeC_01	All right, I'm gonna do it. THE STORMCOIL OVERRIDE.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission14ExchangeC_02	I just need to remember how it works.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission14ExchangeD_01	It was something only I could do… unless I outsmarted myself, heh.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission14_Reaction_01	Oh, that's not good.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission14_Reaction_02	Maybe that will be okay? Maybe not.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission14_Reaction_03	I knew I should have hired another engineer.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission14_Reaction_04	I'm onto something…
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission14ExchangeE_01	That was it—the Stormcoil Override! Let's GO!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission14Victory_01	You should leave without me. I was the one who brought catastrophe upon you all.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission14Victory_02	When I was young, everyone loved the Queen and the palace, and I never bothered to think of what it all meant.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission14Victory_03	I did not see them becoming monsters.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission14Victory_01	You still have friends, just not the one you thought. If we mean anything to you, then help us escape.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission14Victory_01	Exploration, like life, is full of discoveries. All we have to do is learn from them together.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission14Victory_01	Being too kind can be a burden of its own. Together, we will see things clearly and fairly.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission14Victory_04	I see… you have my help, always.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission14_Loss_01	Wow, this isn't stressful at all, eheheheh.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission14_Loss_02	There's no pressure like LOTS of pressure…
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PreMission15_01	That's odd. The engines are running, but we're not moving… It's like the current is holding us here.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission15_01	We should step out and see what's going on.
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission15Start_01	Dathril warned me you might try something.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission15Start_01	Please… let us go. I swear we will never return.
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission15Start_02	You misunderstand. The price for trespassing is death.
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission15ExchangeA_01	Your escape attempt will only hasten your execution.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission15ExchangeA_01	Oof, imagine spending ten thousand years with that attitude.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission15ExchangeA_01	Such threats are wasted on me. 
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission15ExchangeB_01	She is far too strong for us… just try to hold out.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission15ExchangeB_01	I can hardly stand to look!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission15ExchangeC_01	Dathril… you're fighting us again?
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission15ExchangeC_01	It seems once was not enough.
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission15ExchangeD_01	Dathril sent you to Suramar to have a useful ally, not to save your life. It was a game to him.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission15ExchangeD_01	You lie.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission15ExchangeD_01	There's no way you can trust her.
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission15ExchangeE_01	Did you really journey all the way here to see my brother, who never cared for you?
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission15ExchangeE_02	That might be the worst thing I've ever heard.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission15ExchangeE_01	I doubt that, given the path you have chosen!
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission15Victory_01	We have dallied long enough. I will deliver you to the Queen for judgment.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission15Victory_01	No!
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission15Victory_01	Oh dear me.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission15Victory_01	I do not fear her.
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission15EmoteResponse_01	What nonsense.
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission15HeroPower_01	Bow to the tides.
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission15HeroPower_02	Bend or break.
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission15HeroPower_03	The waters always shift.
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission15Loss_01	This was only going to end one way.
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission15Idle_01	It is curious that Dathril never spoke of you all these years. He must have forgotten.
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission15Idle_02	My brother is more loyal to me than anyone. Blood binds us together.
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission15Idle_03	So many years, and so little power you have gained. A pity.
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission15_Lorebook_1_01	My dear handmaiden, I know you can be trusted with the trifling matter of the new prisoners from the surface. I believe they have acted alone and not as leaders of any organized invasion. Please execute them at your leisure, or, if they prove especially lively, bring them to me for amusement.
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission15_Lorebook_2_01	Unnatural things lurk in the depths here. They are connected to an old power, something not demonic or arcane. No one on the surface could understand the sacrifices we have made to survive… or the powers the Queen now commands… 
VO_Story_11_AbyssalEnvoy_Male_Faceless_Play_01	Abandon hope in the endless depths…
VO_Story_11_AbyssalEnvoy_Male_Faceless_Attack_01	Embrace the abyss…
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission16_01	I have no words to soften this blow. But I swear to you, I will fight to the end. I will not forsake you again.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission16_01	Faelin… I am sorry.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PreMission16_02	Not so sorry as I, my friend.
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16Start_01	Why Zainra, what have you brought me today?
VO_Story_11_Handmaiden_015hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16Start_01	Trespassers from the surface, your Highness.
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16Start_02	Delightful. Who shall dispose of them?
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeA_01	Do entertain me.
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeA_01	How messed up is she?!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeA_01	I fear she was never what she seemed.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeA_01	Ahem… does she know that I am dreadful at jokes?
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeA_01	I hope so.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeA_01	You will not be entertained but punished for your cruelty!
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeB_01	Perhaps you will take care of this?
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeB_01	I don't like the look of that thing…
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeB_01	Stay strong. I won't let you fail.
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeC_01	Another disappointment…
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeB_01	I thought it did rather well!
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeD_01	I hate it when things drag on…
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeE_01	Fortunately, I have so many servants…
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeE_01	Servants can't compare to allies.
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeF_01	It seems I must do this myself!
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeG_01	You dare strike royalty?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeH_01	Come, Azshara. All I have lost is because of you! You will drown in your own dark deeds!
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeH_01	Will I? Or perhaps you will hesitate to strike a more familiar face?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeH_02	Not this time.
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeI_01	I knew it. No one can match my power.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeI_01	No, you are wrong.
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeI_01	No... Dathril has finally found his courage.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeJ_01	This amulet has power I never revealed to you. Use it now.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeJ_02	And do not worry. I will face my end as boldly as you were about to.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeJ_01	Dathril…
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission16ExchangeJ_01	Ambassador, you must act!
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16Victory_01	<pained exertion>
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission16Victory_01	The amulet overwhelmed her! Ini, quick, get the Leviathan!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission16Victory_01	I can't believe it…
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_Mission16Victory_01	We have to go. There will be more of them any second.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission16Victory_02	Then this is goodbye.
VO_Story_11_Finley_009hp_Male_Murloc_Story_Faelin_Mission16Victory_01	Ah, Faelin. You did all you could, old chap. My heart is with you.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission16Victory_02	This is our moment! We must go!
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission16Victory_03	But Dathril is still there...
VO_Story_11_Grace_005hp_Female_Human_Story_Faelin_Mission16Victory_01	You have to leave him, Faelin. It's what he wants. The way it always should've been...
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_Mission16Victory_04	Halus... how did you know this would happen!
VO_Story_11_Halus_010hp_Male_BloodElf_Story_Faelin_Mission16Victory_04	This journey has taught me much. But now it must end.
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16EmoteResponse_01	Take care when you speak to me.
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16HeroPower_01	I will put an end to you!
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16HeroPower_02	This is what you deserve.
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16HeroPower_03	Bow to your queen.
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16Loss_01	Everyone learns their place… sooner or later.
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16Idle_01	You used to be so obedient, Faelin! I jest, I have no memory of you whatsoever.
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16Idle_02	I can't even fathom why this is taking up so much of my precious time.
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16Idle_03	I have seen civilizations crumble faster than this…
VO_Story_11_Azshara_016hb_Female_Naga_Mission16_Lorebook_2_01	No one will ever know what has whispered to me from the darkness. They will never understand what I have risked… what I have suffered… to wield such beauty and such terror. These contradictions find no footing in small minds, so I will leave them with the only impression they can truly comprehend: power.
VO_Story_11_Dathril_012hb_Male_Naga_Story_Faelin_Mission16_Lorebook_1_01	In ancient times, my aunt was a priestess of Elune. Blessed by the moon goddess, she created the amulets as talismans to protect her family. After joining the court, Zainra refused hers, so I took it as well as my own, waiting to bestow it on the right person.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PostMission16_01	Ambassador, are you all right?
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PostMission16_01	I was not ready to go. After everything, he really did save me... But more than that—you all did—time and time again.
VO_Story_11_Ini_004hp_Female_MechaGnome_Story_Faelin_PostMission16_01	To be fair, we were also saving ourselves. But you know we wouldn't have done it any other way.
VO_Story_11_Caye_012hp_Female_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PostMission16_02	Past or present, you will always have friends by your side.
VO_Story_11_Faelin_000hp_Male_Nightborne_Story_Faelin_PostMission16_02	I didn't know how much was hidden beneath the surface. But perhaps I will learn.

# RLK Prologue VO
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_UI_AWD_Wing_Unlock_01_A	Join me on the path of the Death Knight. Learn to wield this gift and discover where my power truly comes from.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_ArthasMenethil_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_01_A	I was the prince of Lordaeron. When the undead Scourge came to my land and butchered my people, I swore revenge on the [x] architect of the carnage -- Dreadlord Mal'Ganis.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_ArthasMenethil_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_01_B	The demon fled to Northrend. I tracked him and claimed the deadly runeblade Frostmourne, a weapon of unimaginable power. To wield such a weapon comes at great cost, but I would make any sacrifice to avenge my people.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Demon_MalGanis_InGame_Introduction_01_A	I have been waiting for you, young prince.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_ArthasMenethil_InGame_Introduction_01_B	Mal'Ganis. You will pay for what you did to my people.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Demon_MalGanis_InGame_Turn_03_01_A	The Dark Lord told me you would come.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_ArthasMenethil_InGame_Turn_03_01_B	Nothing will prevent me from having my revenge, demon.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Demon_MalGanis_InGame_Turn_13_01_A	You hear the voice of the Lich King. His power flows through that blade, and you.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_ArthasMenethil_InGame_Turn_13_01_B	I can feel him whisper to me now.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Demon_MalGanis_InGame_Turn_17_01_A	What does the Dark Lord say?
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_ArthasMenethil_InGame_Turn_17_01_B	He tells me the time for my vengeance has come.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Demon_MalGanis_InGame_Turn_17_01_C	What? He can't possibly mean to...
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Demon_MalGanis_InGame_PlayerEquipWeapon_01_A	So, you've taken up Frostmourne at the cost your soul?
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Demon_MalGanis_InGame_PlayerEquipWeapon_01_B	Just as the Dark Lord said you would...
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_ArthasMenethil_InGame_PlayerEquipWeapon_01_C	Save your breath, Mal'Ganis. I heed only Frostmourne now.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_ArthasMenethil_InGame_BossPlaysCard_01_A	The undead...their unholy power speaks to me.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_ArthasMenethil_InGame_BossPlaysCard_01_B	Frostmourne. It hungers for blood.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_ArthasMenethil_InGame_BossPlaysCard_01_C	Impressive, Dreadlord. Soon, I will wield even greater power!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_ArthasMenethil_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_01_A	It is finished.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Demon_MalGanis_InGame_BossIdle_01_A	Your deeds at Stratholme were...inspiring.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Demon_MalGanis_InGame_BossIdle_01_B	Do you hear Frostmourne's call?
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Demon_MalGanis_InGame_BossIdle_01_C	The Dark Lord will guide you.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Demon_MalGanis_InGame_LossPreExplosion_01_A	Such wasted potential...
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Demon_MalGanis_InGame_EmoteResponse_01_A	Have the voices driven you mad, boy?
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_02_A	With Mal'Ganis dispatched, the Lich King urged me to return home, to Lordaeron, to seek the remains of Kel'Thuzad, a necromancer I had slain in my battle against the Scourge. He would teach me to unlock my full power as a Death Knight.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Uther_InGame_Introduction_02_A	Arthas, what have you done?
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Uther_InGame_Turn_03_02_A	I will not let you defile these lands!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_Turn_03_02_B	Stand aside, and I'll make sure you die quickly.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Uther_InGame_Turn_09_02_A	This dark magic will lead the world to ruin, Arthas.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_Turn_09_02_B	That's the idea, old man.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Uther_InGame_Turn_17_02_A	Your father ruled this land for decades, and you've ground it to dust in a matter of days.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_Turn_17_02_B	Very dramatic, Uther.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_MinionDies_02_A	Even in death, my soldiers shall prove useful.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_PlayerPlaysCard_02_A	Remains of the fallen...a source of limitless power.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_PlayerPlaysCard_02_C	Some Death Knight cards have a Rune value. This matters only during deck-building. It has no effect during the game.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Uther_InGame_PlayerPlaysCard_02_B	Blood magic will not save you from the Light, boy.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Uther_InGame_PlayerPlaysCard_02_C	Binding the lives of the innocent? Is this the kind of monster you are now?
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Uther_InGame_PlayerPlaysCard_02_D	Reanimating monstrosities...evil has truly consumed you.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Uther_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_02_A	I dearly hope there's a special place in hell waiting for you, Arthas.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_02_B	We may never know, Uther. I intend to live forever.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Uther_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_02_C	<Death Scream>
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Uther_InGame_BossIdle_02_A	You've made a mockery of the Silver Hand!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Uther_InGame_BossIdle_02_B	How could you do that to your own father?
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Uther_InGame_BossIdle_02_C	Only the Light will prevail here.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Uther_InGame_LossPostExplosion_02_A	Let the Light purge your scarred soul.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Uther_InGame_EmoteResponse_02_A	Spare me your meaningless threats.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_03_A	Uther's men proved useful in swelling the ranks of my undead. We marched through the forests of Quel'Thalas, towards the great elf city of Silvermoon.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_03_B	I sought the Sunwell, a font of mystical energy and the source of the elves' immortal powers. There I would raise Kel'Thuzad as a lich.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_03_C	[x]No army had ever broken through \nthe gates of Silvermoon before, but no \nDeath Knight like me had ever tried.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_Introduction_03_A	Ah, wondrous, eternal Quel'Thalas. I haven't been here since I was a boy.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Female_BloodElf_Sylvanas_InGame_Introduction_03_B	You are not welcome here, prince. I advise you to turn back now.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_Turn_03_03_A	Unholy death has come to your land, ranger.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Female_BloodElf_Sylvanas_InGame_Turn_03_03_B	Do your worst. The elfgate is protected by our most powerful enchantments. You shall not pass.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Female_BloodElf_Sylvanas_InGame_Turn_11_03_A	Raise all the undead you wish, prince. No enemy will ever break through our gates!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_Turn_11_03_B	These lands will fall soon enough...
VO_RLK_Prologue_Female_BloodElf_Sylvanas_InGame_Turn_15_03_A	Did you really believe this plan would work, Death Knight?
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_Turn_15_03_B	I've grown tired of these delays.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_MinionDies_03	You cannot stand against the inevitable.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Female_BloodElf_Sylvanas_InGame_MinionDies_03_B	Curse you monsters! Our first gate has been destroyed, but you won't get through the second.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_MinionDies_03_C	I salute your bravery, elf, but this battle is over.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Female_BloodElf_Sylvanas_InGame_MinionDies_03_D	Then I'll make my stand here, butcher.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Female_BloodElf_Sylvanas_InGame_PlayerPlaysCard_03_A	My arrows are useless! What is this foul trickery?
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_PlayerPlaysCard_03_B	This is only the beginning, elf. Nothing will stop the Scourge.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_PlayerPlaysCard_03_C	Rise my warriors! Now we make our final advance.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Female_BloodElf_Sylvanas_InGame_BossAttacksSpecial_03_A	Warriors of Silvermoon, defend the city! Show them the true strength of Quel'Thalas!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_BossAttacksSpecial_03_B	More defenses? This ranger is beginning to vex me greatly.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Female_BloodElf_Sylvanas_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_03_A	Finish it! I deserve...a clean death.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_03_B	After all you've put me through, the last thing I'll give you is the peace of death.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Female_BloodElf_Sylvanas_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_03_C	No! You wouldn't dare!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Female_0_SylvanasB_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_03_D	<Screams>
VO_RLK_Prologue_Female_BloodElf_Sylvanas_InGame_BossIdle_03_A	The elves of Silvermoon stand against you!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Female_BloodElf_Sylvanas_InGame_BossIdle_03_B	Quel'Thalas will never fall to your corruption!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Female_BloodElf_Sylvanas_InGame_BossIdle_03_C	We will drive you back!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Female_BloodElf_Sylvanas_InGame_LossPreExplosion_03_A	Your legacy is at its end.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Female_BloodElf_Sylvanas_InGame_EmoteResponse_03_A	Silence, prince.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_04_A	Following my triumph at the Sunwell, the Lich King called out to me for aid. The demon hunter Illidan Stormrage had laid siege to the Frozen Throne, where my master's soul was kept in an icy prison.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_UI_AWD_Boss_Reveal_General_04_B	The Lich King's power was mine! I would have it, but one last adversary stood in my way.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_NightElf_Illidan_InGame_Introduction_04_A	The final hour has come at last!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_Turn_03_04_A	You look different, Illidan. I guess the Skull of Gul'dan didn't agree with you.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_NightElf_Illidan_InGame_Turn_03_04_B	I sacrificed everything for this power, Death Knight.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_NightElf_Illidan_InGame_Turn_03_04_C	I became a monster...to hunt monsters like you.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Female_Naga_LadyVashj_InGame_Turn_05_04_A	The last of our reinforcements have arrived, Lord Illidan. My Naga will take care of this fool.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_NightElf_Illidan_InGame_Turn_11_04_A	I will destroy the Frozen Throne. Only then will I win my heart's desire.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_Arthas_InGame_Turn_11_04_B	The tragedy of a broken-hearted demon. How pathetic.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_NightElf_Illidan_InGame_Turn_11_04_C	<ROARS FURIOUSLY>
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Demon_Illidan_InGame_Turn_19_04_A	Today the Lich King will meet his end.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_NightElf_Illidan_InGame_BossAttacksSpecial_04_A	I'll show you true power!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_NightElf_Illidan_InGame_BossAttacksSpecial_04_B	<Yells>
VO_RLK_Prologue_0_0_FroznThrn_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_04_A	At last, Frostmourne has brought you to me. Now the time has come.
VO_RLK_Prologue_0_0_FroznThrn_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_04_B	Break the ice that binds me. RELEASE ME FROM THIS PRISON!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Human_LichKing_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_04_C	Now we are one!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_NightElf_Illidan_InGame_BossIdle_04_A	We could go on fighting like this forever.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_NightElf_Illidan_InGame_BossIdle_04_B	I will have my vengeance!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_NightElf_Illidan_InGame_BossIdle_04_C	You cannot defeat me!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Demon_IllidanD_InGame_BossIdle_04_D	We could go on fighting like this forever.
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Demon_IllidanD_InGame_BossIdle_04_E	I will have my vengeance!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Demon_IllidanD_InGame_BossIdle_04_F	You cannot defeat me!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_NightElf_Illidan_InGame_LossPreExplosion_04_A	The Lich King's reign ends today!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Demon_IllidanD_InGame_LossPreExplosion_04_B	The Lich King's reign ends today!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_NightElf_Illidan_InGame_EmoteResponse_04_A	Nothing will distract me, Death Knight!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Male_Demon_IllidanD_InGame_EmoteResponse_04_B	Nothing will distract me, Death Knight!
VO_RLK_Prologue_IllidanD_004hb2_Male_Demon_InGame_VictoryPreExplosion_01	You must not win...NOOOOO!
VO_RLK_Prologue_Arthas_002hp_Male_Human_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_03	You speak to me... through the sword??? I will do as you command.
VO_RLK_Prologue_FroznThrn_004hb3_Male_Undead_InGame_VictoryPostExplosion_02	Good! GOOD! With Frostmourne in hand, you will be the first of my Death Knights, Prince Arthas.
