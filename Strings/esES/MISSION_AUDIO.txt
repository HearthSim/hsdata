I didn't become a top tinker to hang out in normal places. 
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION1_LOREBOOK_02	Based on the tradition of submergible vessels developed during the Second War, the Leviathan possesses many unique features. Its upgraded fusion core has proved remarkably stable in all instances—except for fires—and its mainframe interface has never been hacked, aside from the Stormcoil Override.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION2_LOREBOOK_01	The city of Zin-Azshari is named for our most glorious queen, Azshara. Her wisdom and power has guided the elves to new heights, and our peerless achievements have become the envy of all. Truly, ours shall be the brightest future.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION2_LOREBOOK_02	The captain's been restless of late. He's havin' strange dreams at night and won't tell me a thing. When I crept up on him last night, he was ramblin' about snake armies and a woman's voice calling him to find some relics. I'm thinkin' about deserting and becoming a gardener.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION3_LOREBOOK_01	I was just going to pillage some new waters when I caught word that an even better ship was already there waiting to be commandeered. And best of all, it is crewed by amateurs! Hah! Sometimes I really am too lucky, even for me.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION3_LOREBOOK_02	We've been followin' the boat since Cap'n Hooktusk first gave the orders near Suramar. Cap'n says it's worth more than the lot of us! Never seen her want anything so bad since she swiped that shady parrot from ol' Rattleswipe back in the day.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION3_LOREBOOK_03	Our voyage is off to a rough start. The ambassador seems to be in his own world, and the crew is just trying to stay in one piece given all the pirates around us. Still, this could be the perfect chance to retake what is mine... and settle that final score.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION5A_LOREBOOK_01	The storm clouds go on and on,\nRaging o'er the ocean long,\nScaring sailors from dusk to dawn,\n"What a cruel phenomenon!"
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION5A_LOREBOOK_02	After years of working for him, I can tell when the ambassador is anxious. He probably wishes we were closer to our destination. I don't know if the others will understand his true motives. Perhaps I am still trying to understand them as well.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION5A_LOREBOOK_03	I say, that ambassador is a curious chap, although I'm getting to like him more and more. Though he claims he just wants to visit his homeland, I do wonder if there is something else going on. At times, I think I catch a slight sadness in his eye, either that or he's not accustomed to the smell of murlocs.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION5A_LOREBOOK_04	As I've gotten to know the ambassador, I've realized he is hiding something from us. There is a secret deep within his heart, and it will take a momentous change to bring it to the surface. Despite this, I still feel he has been pure in his motives, for he hides his secret from pain, not from the will to deceive.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION5B_LOREBOOK_01	Acquire a ship and investigate the newly accessible perimeter of Suramar. Report your findings back as soon as possible. The Horde may be outmaneuvering us to make allies with the Nightborne. -M.S.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION5B_LOREBOOK_02	Built in Stormwind, this merchant vessel has been in my family for two generations. Originally running between its home city and Lordaeron, it has expanded its routes to include nearly every ocean on Azeroth. With its bright red sails flying, it's completed nearly all of its shipments without incident… and even mostly on time.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION6_LOREBOOK_01	Our voyage started smoothly enough as we embarked from Stormwind to Valiance Keep in Northrend. Just as we passed the halfway point, a tremendous hurricane appeared out of nowhere, driving us into unknown waters and damaging the boat beyond repair.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION6_LOREBOOK_02	I wonder why the ambassador never told us exactly why he wanted to return… Could he be hiding something? Is he clever enough to hide something? That associate of his, Caye, sure seems to be. I hope I can trust them.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION6_LOREBOOK_03	Faelin really came through for me. I wasn't sure if I could trust him given his recklessness, and the whole impractical "I have to return home" thing... but there's a lot more to him than I first realized. Whenever he needs me, I know I'll be there.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION7_LOREBOOK_01	I'll read this one! Hm… "Beware the… something? Under the waves. In the eternal uh, BIG SMUDGE, the can't-make-that-out waits for the unwary. Hers is the kingdom of D-O-O…" oh, it's probably not important anyway.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION7_LOREBOOK_02	Though fortune has not seen fit to let me explore the depths, I have heard tale of many formidable creatures, including the mighty Ozumat. It is said that this kraken has been corrupted by dark forces, adding to its immense power.

BOH_FAELIN_MISSION9a_LOREBOOK_01	The ubiquitous murloc proves a loyal kitchen standby on the open seas. Freshly caught, it can make a passable sashimi or poke, but you can also hide any off flavors by putting it in a spicy seafood stew. No one will believe you if you say it's tuna though.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION9a_LOREBOOK_02	It has been one of my chief regrets that the murloc scholarship remains in its infancy. Though other species may take a reductive view of us, murlocs are a highly varied and complex group that has consistently adapted to suit their environments--from freshwater lakes to the bottom of the sea.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION9b_LOREBOOK_01	We Mrrgltons are just your ordinary murloc family. We live in the sunny kelp forest next to some ruins that so delighted our young son, Finley, that he decided to become an explorer! Awfully proud of that little guy, heh. Just wish we got to see more of him.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION9b_LOREBOOK_02	This is no ordinary device, but a uniquely enchanted artifact that will help me in my travels. Because of this, it's very valuable and likely to be stolen if I cart it around Azeroth with me. Kindly look after it well, and don't let Cousin Errgl chew on it when he drops in. My thanks, --F
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION10a_LOREBOOK_01	Anyone found aiding or abetting the resistance efforts of Jarod Shadowsong, Malfurion Stormrage, and Tyrande Whisperwind or their co-conspirators will face swift and brutal punishment, including imprisonment or execution. Issued on order from her highness, the Light of Lights, Queen Azshara.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION10a_LOREBOOK_02	After the resistance forces triumphed over Queen Azshara's demons, the Sundering began. This cataclysmic force destroyed the palace in Zin-Azshari, sending all of its inhabitants to the bottom of the sea. Somehow, they did not perish… but instead transformed into grotesque naga, allowing them to survive underwater.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION10a_LOREBOOK_02b	After the resistance forces triumphed over Queen Azshara's demons, the Sundering began. This cataclysmic force destroyed the palace in Zin-Azshari, sending all of its inhabitants to the bottom of the sea. Somehow, they did not perish… but instead transformed into grotesque naga, allowing them to survive underwater.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION10a_LOREBOOK_03	Dear Faelin, I thought the written word would be the best possible way to convey my gratitude. I know it wasn't easy enduring our little family reunion, but your intervention truly made all the difference. I trust we shall be fast friends no matter what lies ahead!
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION10a_LOREBOOK_04	Grace, I hope this message finds you well--or finds you at all now that I've thrown it into the sea... I just wanted to apologize to you again. I wish I could explain further, but let me just say you've done a valuable service to the Kingdom of Stormwind. If we meet again, let it be as friends.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION10b_LOREBOOK_01	Though many of Elune's devoted are strong warriors, there is still no ultimate test of their abilities. The High Priestess has given me permission to create a trial that will determine the limits of their spiritual, as well as physical, fortitude. Perhaps if we locate it in Zin-Azshari, we will get more recruits.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION10b_LOREBOOK_02	Long years have passed since Queen Azshara or any of her heralds saw fit to visit our temple in Suramar. I think the High Priestess suspects much she cannot say. The last gift from the palace was a large crystal that I have been granted to use in my warrior's trial. 
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION11_LOREBOOK_01	It has come to our attention that the people of Suramar are restless and wish to receive more updates from the palace. Kindly appoint a new ambassador, someone well-connected but agreeable, and send them to us at once. When placated, I assure you the people will be easily managed.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION11_LOREBOOK_02	Faelin, I just want you to know I miss you already. But you have to believe me when I tell you that Zin-Azshari is no longer the same. Something is wrong and no one will see it. Your safety means everything to me, even if we must be apart for a while. Hopefully it is not too long.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION12_LOREBOOK_01	No matter how many tricks you play on me, or how many times we get in trouble…\nOr how many times I forget your birthday, or don't answer your letters…\nWe'll always be friends forever. Friends forever!
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION12_LOREBOOK_02	House Evenlar is an ancient family with close connections to the queen. It is said that there's always an Evenlar among Azshara's royal retinue, much to our pride. On the... other side of the family, we also have a relative in the Temple of Elune in Suramar, which came as quite a surprise to the rest of us.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION13_LOREBOOK_01	Scholars and officials may tell you one thing, but I know the truth. There is only one law in all of Zin-Azshari, and that is to please the queen. Should you violate that law, you may find yourself… here.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION13_LOREBOOK_02	Will they ever release me, I wonder? The Queen knows my true feelings, I'm certain of it. But my family may still be on my side. If they intervene for me, they will risk everything… Even my friend must think the world of me, never seeing the truth. In pleasing everyone, I have only betrayed them all.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION15_LOREBOOK_01	My dear handmaiden, I know you can be trusted with the trifling matter of the new prisoners from the surface. I believe they have acted alone and not as leaders of any organized invasion. Please execute them at your leisure, or, if they prove especially lively, bring them to me for amusement.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION15_LOREBOOK_02	Unnatural things lurk in the depths here. They are connected to an old power, something not demonic or arcane. No one on the surface could understand the sacrifices we have made to survive… or the powers the Queen now commands… 
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION16_LOREBOOK_01	No one will ever know what has whispered to me from the darkness. They will never understand what I have risked… what I have suffered… to wield such beauty and such terror. These contradictions find no footing in small minds, so I will leave them with the only impression they can truly comprehend: power.
BOH_FAELIN_MISSION16_LOREBOOK_02	In ancient times, my aunt was a priestess of Elune. Blessed by the moon goddess, she created the amulets as talismans to protect her family. After joining the court, Zainra refused hers, so I took it as well as my own, waiting to bestow it on the right person.

BOH_FAELIN_06	Attack the minions across the board to save them from sinking!
BOH_FAELIN_06a	Defeat enemy minions so Captain Maya can help more passengers and crew escape!	
BOH_FAELIN_06b	Minions Left to Rescue

TB_BOTB_MUKLA_LOREBOOK1	He might seem easygoing, but Mister Mukla ain’t one to monkey around. All his fans know that he’ll bring the jungle beats destined to loop over and over in your head. After releasing his smash hit album, Stranglethorn Forever, he agreed to open up the festival, and I just couldn’t be happier!
TB_BOTB_ZOK_LOREBOOK1	It's finally the night of Zok Fogsnout's big homecoming performance! The Razorfen Downs is decked out in lights, and the whole place is positively vibin'. I wonder if I can get his autograph...
TB_BOTB_INZAH_LOREBOOK1	The main thing I’d like people to know is just that music is a part of you. Maybe it’s a small part, but it’s there inside. And once you start to unlock it, and really reveal its potential, it can take you to places you never even imagined. And that’s just elemental.
TB_BOTB_MANASTORM_LOREBOOK1	I went into my workshop today, and Millhouse was in there! Said he needed parts for some sort of... music making machine. I kicked him out, of course. "Music machine"... ha!
TB_BOTB_HEDANIS_LOREBOOK1	Don't let their charming voices and handsome faces fool you, the story of Hedanis and his pop band of beauties is no fairy tale. The group was founded by none other than Don Han'Cho, the notorious crime boss. The band and its members are completely manufactured, much like their music. After a lengthy audition process, Hedanis and his fellow beauties were selected, taught how to fake playing instruments, and sent before crowds of screaming (and well-compensated) teenagers. Soon, thanks to a few catchy melodies, the crowds screamed on their own. This fake band had found real success, with a handsome cut going straight to the Grimestreet Gang. 
TB_BOTB_HEDANIS_LOREBOOK2	Following the Battle of the Bands in Thousand Needles, Hedanis took a hiatus from pop music to discover himself. He journeyed to Pandaria, where he found meditative peace in Tian Monastery and took new musical inspiration from the Pandaren there. He returned for a whirlwind tour of Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms, but his solo performances failed to capture the energy (and ticket sales) of his previous work.
TB_BOTB_KANGOR_LOREBOOK1	It might surprise you to know that me and Kangor go way back. I feel like everyone, I mean everyone, should have a foundation in the classics. And you can't get more classic than this guy. Feel the Groove is an album that will inform generations to come, and nothing will ever hit like a Disco Maul. Trust me, I know.
TB_BOTB_BLINGTRON_LOREBOOK1	Grandfather had a real sense of humor when he invented the Blingtron. I discovered today that his 3000 prototype loves music when it started copying my work whistles. I wonder if it can sing...
TB_BOTB_CAGEHEAD_LOREBOOK1	The thing I love most about being a Blighthead is... everything. The guitars, the screaming, the putrid clouds of plagued air, it all creates an atmosphere that speaks to me. No matter how many times Death Metal Knight crashes the set, I’ll fight for my band with all I’ve got. For the Boar!
TB_BOTB_RIN_LOREBOOK1	I’d really love to tell you more about Rin. She’s a very special artist, a magical artist for sure. Sometimes I feel like she was conjured from a whole different plane of existence to bring her unique power to the stage. But you know, I really respect her privacy, so I’m gonna have to end this here.
TB_BOTB_VOONE_LOREBOOK1	Voone’s shocking rock history starts in Gurubashi Arena, where he dispatched his opponents while also playing some surprisingly catchy tunes. Eventually, his riveting rhythms brought him to tamer audiences, and, though we were all a little nervous, he settled in as a reliable regular. But competitors better mind their manners if they ever cross him backstage.
TB_BOTB_HALVERIA_LOREBOOK1	Nobody believed I'd keep writing music. They laughed when I named my guitar. But I've never found anything else that lets me express myself so clearly. Music is truth... and truth hurts.
TB_BOTB_ETC_LOREBOOK1	Music’s always changing, moving toward the sound and feel of the future. I need to find someone who can be that voice--that dawn of something new. There are a lot of incredible performers out there, but even I don’t know who can take this moment and make it a movement.
